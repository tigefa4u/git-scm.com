<h2 id="_summary_4">Summary</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have several options to get a remote Git repository up and running so that you can collaborate with others or share your work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Running your own server gives you a lot of control and allows you to run the server within your own firewall, but such a server generally requires a fair amount of your time to set up and maintain.
If you place your data on a hosted server, it’s easy to set up and maintain; however, you have to be able to keep your code on someone else’s servers, and some organizations don’t allow that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
