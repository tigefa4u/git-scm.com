<h2 id="_summary_2">Summary</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ve covered basic branching and merging in Git.
You should feel comfortable creating and switching to new branches, switching between branches and merging local branches together.
You should also be able to share your branches by pushing them to a shared server, working with others on shared branches and rebasing your branches before they are shared.
Next, we’ll cover what you’ll need to run your own Git repository-hosting server.</p>
