<div class="paragraph">
<p>There were also quite a number of lower level plumbing commands that we encountered in the book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first one we encounter is <code>ls-remote</code> in <a href="{{< relurl "book/id/v2/ch00/_pr_refs" >}}">Pull Request Refs</a> which we use to look at the raw references on the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use <code>ls-files</code> in <a href="{{< relurl "book/id/v2/ch00/_manual_remerge" >}}">Manual File Re-merging</a>, <a href="{{< relurl "book/id/v2/ch00/_rerere" >}}">Rerere</a> and <a href="{{< relurl "book/id/v2/ch00/_the_index" >}}">The Index</a> to take a more raw look at what your staging area looks like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also mention <code>rev-parse</code> in <a href="{{< relurl "book/id/v2/ch00/_branch_references" >}}">Branch References</a> to take just about any string and turn it into an object SHA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, most of the low level plumbing commands we cover are in <a href="{{< relurl "book/id/v2/ch00/_git_internals" >}}">Git Internals</a>, which is more or less what the chapter is focused on. We tried to avoid use of them throughout most of the rest of the book.</p>
