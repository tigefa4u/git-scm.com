<h2 id="_branch_management">Branch Management</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Now that you’ve created, merged, and deleted some branches, let’s look at some branch-management tools that will come in handy when you begin using branches all the time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git branch</code> command does more than just create and delete branches.
If you run it with no arguments, you get a simple listing of your current branches:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch
  iss53
* master
  testing</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice the <code>*</code> character that prefixes the <code>master</code> branch: it indicates the branch that you currently have checked out (i.e., the branch that <code>HEAD</code> points to).
This means that if you commit at this point, the <code>master</code> branch will be moved forward with your new work.
To see the last commit on each branch, you can run <code>git branch -v</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch -v
  iss53   93b412c fix javascript issue
* master  7a98805 Merge branch 'iss53'
  testing 782fd34 add scott to the author list in the readmes</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The useful <code>--merged</code> and <code>--no-merged</code> options can filter this list to branches that you have or have not yet merged into the branch you’re currently on.
To see which branches are already merged into the branch you’re on, you can run <code>git branch --merged</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch --merged
  iss53
* master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because you already merged in <code>iss53</code> earlier, you see it in your list.
Branches on this list without the <code>*</code> in front of them are generally fine to delete with <code>git branch -d</code>; you’ve already incorporated their work into another branch, so you’re not going to lose anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To see all the branches that contain work you haven’t yet merged in, you can run <code>git branch --no-merged</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch --no-merged
  testing</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This shows your other branch.
Because it contains work that isn’t merged in yet, trying to delete it with <code>git branch -d</code> will fail:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch -d testing
error: The branch 'testing' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D testing'.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you really do want to delete the branch and lose that work, you can force it with <code>-D</code>, as the helpful message points out.</p>
