<h2 id="_git_daemon">Git Daemon</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Next we’ll set up a daemon serving repositories over the “Git” protocol. This is common choice for fast, unauthenticated access to your Git data. Remember that since it’s not an authenticated service, anything you serve over this protocol is public within it’s network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re running this on a server outside your firewall, it should only be used for projects that are publicly visible to the world.
If the server you’re running it on is inside your firewall, you might use it for projects that a large number of people or computers (continuous integration or build servers) have read-only access to, when you don’t want to have to add an SSH key for each.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In any case, the Git protocol is relatively easy to set up.
Basically, you need to run this command in a daemonized manner:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">git daemon --reuseaddr --base-path=/opt/git/ /opt/git/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>--reuseaddr</code> allows the server to restart without waiting for old connections to time out, the <code>--base-path</code> option allows people to clone projects without specifying the entire path, and the path at the end tells the Git daemon where to look for repositories to export.
If you’re running a firewall, you’ll also need to punch a hole in it at port 9418 on the box you’re setting this up on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can daemonize this process a number of ways, depending on the operating system you’re running.
On an Ubuntu machine, you can use an Upstart script.
So, in the following file</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">/etc/event.d/local-git-daemon</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>you put this script:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">start on startup
stop on shutdown
exec /usr/bin/git daemon \
    --user=git --group=git \
    --reuseaddr \
    --base-path=/opt/git/ \
    /opt/git/
respawn</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For security reasons, it is strongly encouraged to have this daemon run as a user with read-only permissions to the repositories – you can easily do this by creating a new user <em>git-ro</em> and running the daemon as them.
For the sake of simplicity we’ll simply run it as the same <em>git</em> user that Gitosis is running as.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you restart your machine, your Git daemon will start automatically and respawn if it goes down.
To get it running without having to reboot, you can run this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">initctl start local-git-daemon</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On other systems, you may want to use <code>xinetd</code>, a script in your <code>sysvinit</code> system, or something else – as long as you get that command daemonized and watched somehow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you have to tell Git which repositories to allow unauthenticated Git server-based access to. You can do this in each repository by creating a file name <code>git-daemon-export-ok</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd /path/to/project.git
$ touch git-daemon-export-ok</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The presence of that file tells Git that it’s OK to serve this project without authentication.</p>
