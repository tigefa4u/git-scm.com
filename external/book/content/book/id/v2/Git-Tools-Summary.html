<h2 id="_summary_6">Summary</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ve seen a number of advanced tools that allow you to manipulate your commits and staging area more precisely.
When you notice issues, you should be able to easily figure out what commit introduced them, when, and by whom.
If you want to use subprojects in your project, you’ve learned how to accommodate those needs.
At this point, you should be able to do most of the things in Git that you’ll need on the command line day to day and feel comfortable doing so.</p>
