<p>Throughout the book we have introduced dozens of Git commands and have tried hard to introduce them within something of a narrative, adding more commands to the story slowly.
However, this leaves us with examples of usage of the commands somewhat scattered throughout the whole book.</p><p>In this appendix, we’ll go through all the Git commands we addressed throughout the book, grouped roughly by what they’re used for.
We’ll talk about what each command very generally does and then point out where in the book you can find us having used it.</p>
<h2 id="_setup_and_config">Setup and Config</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two commands that are used quite a lot, from the first invocations of Git to common every day tweaking and referencing, the <code>config</code> and <code>help</code> commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_config_2">git config</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git has a default way of doing hundreds of things.
For a lot of these things, you can tell Git to default to doing them a different way, or set your preferences.
This involves everything from telling Git what your name is to specific terminal color preferences or what editor you use.
There are several files this command will read from and write to so you can set values globally or down to specific repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git config</code> command has been used in nearly every chapter of the book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="{{< relurl "book/mk/v2/ch00/_first_time" >}}">First-Time Git Setup</a> we used it to specify our name, email address and editor preference before we even got started using Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="{{< relurl "book/mk/v2/ch00/_git_aliases" >}}">Git Алијаси</a> we showed how you could use it to create shorthand commands that expand to long option sequences so you don’t have to type them every time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="{{< relurl "book/mk/v2/ch00/_rebasing" >}}">Ребаза</a> we used it to make <code>--rebase</code> the default when you run <code>git pull</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="{{< relurl "book/mk/v2/ch00/_credential_caching" >}}">Складирање на ингеренции</a> we used it to set up a default store for your HTTP passwords.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="{{< relurl "book/mk/v2/ch00/_keyword_expansion" >}}">Keyword Expansion</a> we showed how to set up smudge and clean filters on content coming in and out of Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, basically the entirety of <a href="{{< relurl "book/mk/v2/ch00/_git_config" >}}">Git Configuration</a> is dedicated to the command.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_help_2">git help</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git help</code> command is used to show you all the documentation shipped with Git about any command.
While we’re giving a rough overview of most of the more popular ones in this appendix, for a full listing of all of the possible options and flags for every command, you can always run <code>git help &lt;command&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We introduced the <code>git help</code> command in <a href="{{< relurl "book/mk/v2/ch00/_git_help" >}}">Getting Help</a> and showed you how to use it to find more information about the <code>git shell</code> in <a href="{{< relurl "book/mk/v2/ch00/_setting_up_server" >}}">Поставување на серверот</a>.</p>
