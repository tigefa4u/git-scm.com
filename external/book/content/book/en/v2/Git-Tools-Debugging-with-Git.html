<h2 id="_debugging_with_git">Debugging with Git</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to being primarily for version control, Git also provides a couple commands to help you debug your source code projects.
Because Git is designed to handle nearly any type of content, these tools are pretty generic, but they can often help you hunt for a bug or culprit when things go wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_file_annotation">File Annotation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you track down a bug in your code and want to know when it was introduced and why, file annotation is often your best tool.
It shows you what commit was the last to modify each line of any file.
So if you see that a method in your code is buggy, you can annotate the file with <code>git blame</code> to determine which commit was responsible for the introduction of that line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following example uses <code>git blame</code> to determine which commit and committer was responsible for lines in the top-level Linux kernel <code>Makefile</code> and, further, uses the <code>-L</code> option to restrict the output of the annotation to lines 69 through 82 of that file:</p>

<p>Notice that the first field is the partial SHA-1 of the commit that last modified that line.
The next two fields are values extracted from that commit — the author name and the authored date of that commit — so you can easily see who modified that line and when.
After that come the line number and the content of the file.
Also note the <code>^1da177e4c3f4</code> commit lines, where the <code>^</code> prefix designates lines that were introduced in the repository’s initial commit and have remained unchanged ever since.
This is a tad confusing, because now you’ve seen at least three different ways that Git uses the <code>^</code> to modify a commit SHA-1, but that is what it means here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another cool thing about Git is that it doesn’t track file renames explicitly.
It records the snapshots and then tries to figure out what was renamed implicitly, after the fact.
One of the interesting features of this is that you can ask it to figure out all sorts of code movement as well.
If you pass <code>-C</code> to <code>git blame</code>, Git analyzes the file you’re annotating and tries to figure out where snippets of code within it originally came from if they were copied from elsewhere.
For example, say you are refactoring a file named <code>GITServerHandler.m</code> into multiple files, one of which is <code>GITPackUpload.m</code>.
By blaming <code>GITPackUpload.m</code> with the <code>-C</code> option, you can see where sections of the code originally came from:</p>

<p>This is really useful.
Normally, you get as the original commit the commit where you copied the code over, because that is the first time you touched those lines in this file.
Git tells you the original commit where you wrote those lines, even if it was in another file.</p>

<h3 id="_binary_search">Binary Search</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Annotating a file helps if you know where the issue is to begin with.
If you don’t know what is breaking, and there have been dozens or hundreds of commits since the last state where you know the code worked, you’ll likely turn to <code>git bisect</code> for help.
The <code>bisect</code> command does a binary search through your commit history to help you identify as quickly as possible which commit introduced an issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s say you just pushed out a release of your code to a production environment, you’re getting bug reports about something that wasn’t happening in your development environment, and you can’t imagine why the code is doing that.
You go back to your code, and it turns out you can reproduce the issue, but you can’t figure out what is going wrong.
You can <em>bisect</em> the code to find out.
First you run <code>git bisect start</code> to get things going, and then you use <code>git bisect bad</code> to tell the system that the current commit you’re on is broken.
Then, you must tell bisect when the last known good state was, using <code>git bisect good &lt;good_commit&gt;</code>:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git figured out that about 12 commits came between the commit you marked as the last good commit (v1.0) and the current bad version, and it checked out the middle one for you.
At this point, you can run your test to see if the issue exists as of this commit.
If it does, then it was introduced sometime before this middle commit; if it doesn’t, then the problem was introduced sometime after the middle commit.
It turns out there is no issue here, and you tell Git that by typing <code>git bisect good</code> and continue your journey:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you’re on another commit, halfway between the one you just tested and your bad commit.
You run your test again and find that this commit is broken, so you tell Git that with <code>git bisect bad</code>:</p>

<p>This is a powerful tool that can help you check hundreds of commits for an introduced bug in minutes.
In fact, if you have a script that will exit 0 if the project is good or non-0 if the project is bad, you can fully automate <code>git bisect</code>.
First, you again tell it the scope of the bisect by providing the known bad and good commits.
You can do this by listing them with the <code>bisect start</code> command if you want, listing the known bad commit first and the known good commit second:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git bisect start HEAD v1.0
$ git bisect run test-error.sh</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Doing so automatically runs <code>test-error.sh</code> on each checked-out commit until Git finds the first broken commit.
You can also run something like <code>make</code> or <code>make tests</code> or whatever you have that runs automated tests for you.</p>
