<h2 id="_email">Email</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many Git projects, including Git itself, are entirely maintained over mailing lists. Git has a number of tools built into it that help make this process easier, from generating patches you can easily email to applying those patches from an email box.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_apply">git apply</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git apply</code> command applies a patch created with the <code>git diff</code> or even GNU diff command. It is similar to what the <code>patch</code> command might do with a few small differences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We demonstrate using it and the circumstances in which you might do so in <a href="{{< relurl "book/uz/v2/ch00/_patches_from_email" >}}">Applying Patches from E-mail</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_am_2">git am</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git am</code> command is used to apply patches from an email inbox, specifically one that is mbox formatted. This is useful for receiving patches over email and applying them to your project easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We covered usage and workflow around <code>git am</code> in <a href="{{< relurl "book/uz/v2/ch00/_git_am" >}}">Applying a Patch with <code>am</code></a> including using the <code>--resolved</code>, <code>-i</code> and <code>-3</code> options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also a number of hooks you can use to help with the workflow around <code>git am</code> and they are all covered in <a href="{{< relurl "book/uz/v2/ch00/_email_hooks" >}}">E-mail Workflow Hooks</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also use it to apply patch formatted GitHub Pull Request changes in <a href="{{< relurl "book/uz/v2/ch00/_email_notifications" >}}">Email Notifications</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_format_patch">git format-patch</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git format-patch</code> command is used to generate a series of patches in mbox format that you can use to send to a mailing list properly formatted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We go through an example of contributing to a project using the <code>git format-patch</code> tool in <a href="{{< relurl "book/uz/v2/ch00/_project_over_email" >}}">Public Project over E-Mail</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_send_email">git send-email</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git send-email</code> command is used to send patches that are generated with <code>git format-patch</code> over email.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We go through an example of contributing to a project by sending patches with the <code>git send-email</code> tool in <a href="{{< relurl "book/uz/v2/ch00/_project_over_email" >}}">Public Project over E-Mail</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_request_pull">git request-pull</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git request-pull</code> command is simply used to generate an example message body to email to someone. If you have a branch on a public server and want to let someone know how to integrate those changes without sending the patches over email, you can run this command and send the output to the person you want to pull the changes in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We demonstrate how to use <code>git request-pull</code> to generate a pull message in <a href="{{< relurl "book/uz/v2/ch00/_public_project" >}}">Forked Public Project</a>.</p>
