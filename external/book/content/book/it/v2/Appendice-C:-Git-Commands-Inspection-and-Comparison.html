<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_show">git show</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git show</code> command can show a Git object in a simple and human readable way. Normally you would use this to show the information about a tag or a commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first use it to show annotated tag information in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_annotated_tags" >}}">Annotated Tags</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later we use it quite a bit in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_revision_selection" >}}">Revision Selection</a> to show the commits that our various revision selections resolve to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the more interesting things we do with <code>git show</code> is in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_manual_remerge" >}}">Manual File Re-merging</a> to extract specific file contents of various stages during a merge conflict.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_shortlog">git shortlog</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git shortlog</code> command is used to summarize the output of <code>git log</code>. It will take many of the same options that the <code>git log</code> command will but instead of listing out all of the commits it will present a summary of the commits grouped by author.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We showed how to use it to create a nice changelog in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_the_shortlog" >}}">The Shortlog</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_describe">git describe</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git describe</code> command is used to take anything that resolves to a commit and produces a string that is somewhat human-readable and will not change. Itâ€™s a way to get a description of a commit that is as unambiguous as a commit SHA but more understandable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use <code>git describe</code> in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_build_number" >}}">Generating a Build Number</a> and <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_preparing_release" >}}">Preparing a Release</a> to get a string to name our release file after.</p>
