<h2 id="_branching_and_merging">Branching and Merging</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are just a handful of commands that implement most of the branching and merging functionality in Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_branch">git branch</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git branch</code> command is actually something of a branch management tool. It can list the branches you have, create a new branch, delete branches and rename branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/ch03-git-branching" >}}">[ch03-git-branching]</a> is dedicated to the <code>branch</code> command and it’s used throughout the entire chapter. We first introduce it in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_create_new_branch" >}}">Creating a New Branch</a> and we go through most of it’s other features (listing and deleting) in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_branch_management" >}}">Branch Management</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_tracking_branches" >}}">Tracking Branches</a> we use the <code>git branch -u</code> option to set up a tracking branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we go through some of what it does in the background in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_git_refs" >}}">Git References</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_checkout">git checkout</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git checkout</code> command is used to switch branches and  check content out into your working directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first encounter the command in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_switching_branches" >}}">Switching Branches</a> along with the <code>git branch</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We see how to use it to start tracking branches with the <code>--track</code> flag in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_tracking_branches" >}}">Tracking Branches</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use it to reintroduce file conflicts with <code>--conflict=diff3</code> in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_checking_out_conflicts" >}}">Checking Out Conflicts</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We go into closer detail on it’s relationship with <code>git reset</code> in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_git_reset" >}}">Reset Demystified</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we go into some implementation detail in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_the_head" >}}">The HEAD</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_merge">git merge</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git merge</code> tool is used to merge one or more branches  into the branch you have checked out. It will then advance the current branch to the result of the merge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git merge</code> command was first introduced in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_basic_branching" >}}">Basic Branching</a>. Though it is used in various places in the book, there are very few variations of the <code>merge</code> command — generally just <code>git merge &lt;branch&gt;</code> with the name of the single branch you want to merge in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We covered how to do a squashed merge (where Git merges the work but pretends like it’s just a new commit without recording the history of the branch you’re merging in) at the very end of <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_public_project" >}}">Forked Public Project</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We went over a lot about the merge process and command, including the <code>-Xignore-all-whitespace</code> command and the <code>--abort</code> flag to abort a problem merge in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_advanced_merging" >}}">Advanced Merging</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We learned how to verify signatures before merging if your project is using GPG signing in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_signing_commits" >}}">Signing Commits</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we learned about Subtree merging in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_subtree_merge" >}}">Subtree Merging</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_mergetool">git mergetool</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git mergetool</code> command simply launches an external merge helper in case you have issues with a merge in Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We mention it quickly in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_basic_merge_conflicts" >}}">Basic Merge Conflicts</a> and go into detail on how to implement your own external merge tool in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_external_merge_tools" >}}">External Merge and Diff Tools</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_log">git log</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git log</code> command is used to show the reachable recorded history of a project from the most recent commit snapshot backwards. By default it will only show the history of the branch you’re currently on, but can be given different or even multiple heads or branches from which to traverse. It is also often used to show differences between two or more branches at the commit level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command is used in nearly every chapter of the book to demonstrate the history of a project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We introduce the command and cover it in some depth in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_viewing_history" >}}">Viewing the Commit History</a>. There we look at the <code>-p</code> and <code>--stat</code> option to get an idea of what was introduced in each commit and the <code>--pretty</code> and <code>--oneline</code> options to view the history more concisely, along with some simple date and author filtering options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_create_new_branch" >}}">Creating a New Branch</a> we use it with the <code>--decorate</code> option to easily visualize where our branch pointers are located and we also use the <code>--graph</code> option to see what divergent histories look like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_private_team" >}}">Private Small Team</a> and <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_commit_ranges" >}}">Commit Ranges</a> we cover the <code>branchA..branchB</code> syntax to use the <code>git log</code> command to see what commits are unique to a branch relative to another branch. In <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_commit_ranges" >}}">Commit Ranges</a> we go through this fairly extensively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_merge_log" >}}">Merge Log</a> and <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_triple_dot" >}}">Triple Dot</a> we cover using the <code>branchA...branchB</code> format and the <code>--left-right</code> syntax to see what is in one branch or the other but not in both. In <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_merge_log" >}}">Merge Log</a> we also look at how to use the <code>--merge</code> option to help with merge conflict debugging as well as using the <code>--cc</code> option to look at merge commit conflicts in your history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_git_reflog" >}}">RefLog Shortnames</a> we use the <code>-g</code> option to view the Git reflog through this tool instead of doing branch traversal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_searching" >}}">Searching</a> we look at using the <code>-S</code> and <code>-L</code> options to do fairly sophisticated searches for something that happened historically in the code such as seeing the history of a function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_signing_commits" >}}">Signing Commits</a> we see how to use <code>--show-signature</code> to add a validation string to each commit in the <code>git log</code> output based on if it was validly signed or not.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_stash">git stash</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git stash</code> command is used to temporarily store uncommitted work in order to clean out your working directory without having to commit unfinished work on a branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is basically entirely covered in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_git_stashing" >}}">Stashing and Cleaning</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h3 id="_git_tag">git tag</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git tag</code> command is used to give a permanent bookmark to a specific point in the code history. Generally this is used for things like releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command is introduced and covered in detail in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_git_tagging" >}}">Tagging</a> and we use it in practice in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_tagging_releases" >}}">Tagging Your Releases</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also cover how to create a GPG signed tag with the <code>-s</code> flag and verify one with the <code>-v</code> flag in <a href="{{< relurl "book/it/v2/ch00/r_signing" >}}">Signing Your Work</a>.</p>
