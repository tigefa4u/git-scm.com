<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don’t want to go through all of the work involved in setting up your own Git server, you have several options for hosting your Git projects on an external dedicated hosting site.
Doing so offers a number of advantages: a hosting site is generally quick to set up and easy to start projects on, and no server maintenance or monitoring is involved.
Even if you set up and run your own server internally, you may still want to use a public hosting site for your open source code – it’s generally easier for the open source community to find and help you with.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These days, you have a huge number of hosting options to choose from, each with different advantages and disadvantages.
To see an up-to-date list, check out the GitHosting page on the main Git wiki at <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitHosting" class="bare">https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitHosting</a></p>

<p>We’ll cover using GitHub in detail in <a href="{{< relurl "book/zh-tw/v2/ch00/ch06-github" >}}">[ch06-github]</a>, as it is the largest Git host out there and you may need to interact with projects hosted on it in any case, but there are dozens more to choose from should you not want to set up your own Git server.</p>
