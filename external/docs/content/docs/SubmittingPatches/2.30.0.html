<h2 id="_guidelines"><a class="anchor" href="#_guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are some guidelines for people who want to contribute their code to this
software. There is also a <a href="{{< relurl "docs/MyFirstContribution" >}}">step-by-step tutorial</a>
available which covers many of these same guidelines.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="base-branch"><a class="anchor" href="#base-branch"></a>Decide what to base your work on.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, always base your work on the oldest branch that your
change is relevant to.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A bugfix should be based on <code>maint</code> in general. If the bug is not
present in <code>maint</code>, base it on <code>master</code>. For a bug that&#8217;s not yet
in <code>master</code>, find the topic that introduces the regression, and
base your work on the tip of the topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new feature should be based on <code>master</code> in general. If the new
feature depends on a topic that is in <code>seen</code>, but not in <code>master</code>,
base your work on the tip of that topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corrections and enhancements to a topic not yet in <code>master</code> should
be based on the tip of that topic. If the topic has not been merged
to <code>next</code>, it&#8217;s alright to add a note to squash minor corrections
into the series.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the exceptional case that a new feature depends on several topics
not in <code>master</code>, start working on <code>next</code> or <code>seen</code> privately and send
out patches for discussion. Before the final merge, you may have to
wait until some of the dependent topics graduate to <code>master</code>, and
rebase your work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some parts of the system have dedicated maintainers with their own
repositories (see the section "Subsystems" below).  Changes to
these parts should be based on their trees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To find the tip of a topic branch, run <code>git log --first-parent
master..seen</code> and look for the merge commit. The second parent of this
commit is the tip of the topic branch.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="separate-commits"><a class="anchor" href="#separate-commits"></a>Make separate commits for logically separate changes.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unless your patch is really trivial, you should not be sending
out a patch that was generated between your working tree and
your commit head.  Instead, always make a commit with complete
commit message and generate a series of patches from your
repository.  It is a good discipline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Give an explanation for the change(s) that is detailed enough so
that people can judge if it is good thing to do, without reading
the actual patch text to determine how well the code does what
the explanation promises to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your description starts to get too long, that&#8217;s a sign that you
probably need to split up your commit to finer grained pieces.
That being said, patches which plainly describe the things that
help reviewers check the patch, and future maintainers understand
the code, are the most beautiful patches.  Descriptions that summarize
the point in the subject well, and describe the motivation for the
change, the approach taken by the change, and if relevant how this
differs substantially from the prior version, are all good things
to have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure that you have tests for the bug you are fixing.  See
<code>t/README</code> for guidance.</p>
</div>
<div id="tests" class="paragraph">
<p>When adding a new feature, make sure that you have new tests to show
the feature triggers the new behavior when it should, and to show the
feature does not trigger when it shouldn&#8217;t.  After any code change, make
sure that the entire test suite passes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have an account at GitHub (and you can get one for free to work
on open source projects), you can use their Travis CI integration to
test your changes on Linux, Mac (and hopefully soon Windows).  See
GitHub-Travis CI hints section for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not forget to update the documentation to describe the updated
behavior and make sure that the resulting documentation set formats
well (try the Documentation/doc-diff script).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We currently have a liberal mixture of US and UK English norms for
spelling and grammar, which is somewhat unfortunate.  A huge patch that
touches the files all over the place only to correct the inconsistency
is not welcome, though.  Potential clashes with other changes that can
result from such a patch are not worth it.  We prefer to gradually
reconcile the inconsistencies in favor of US English, with small and
easily digestible patches, as a side effect of doing some other real
work in the vicinity (e.g. rewriting a paragraph for clarity, while
turning en_UK spelling to en_US).  Obvious typographical fixes are much
more welcomed ("teh &#8594; "the"), preferably submitted as independent
patches separate from other documentation changes.</p>
</div>
<div id="whitespace-check" class="paragraph">
<p>Oh, another thing.  We are picky about whitespaces.  Make sure your
changes do not trigger errors with the sample pre-commit hook shipped
in <code>templates/hooks--pre-commit</code>.  To help ensure this does not happen,
run <code>git diff --check</code> on your changes before you commit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="describe-changes"><a class="anchor" href="#describe-changes"></a>Describe your changes well.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first line of the commit message should be a short description (50
characters is the soft limit, see DISCUSSION in <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-commit" >}}'>git-commit[1]</a>),
and should skip the full stop.  It is also conventional in most cases to
prefix the first line with "area: " where the area is a filename or
identifier for the general area of the code being modified, e.g.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>doc: clarify distinction between sign-off and pgp-signing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>githooks.txt: improve the intro section</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If in doubt which identifier to use, run <code>git log --no-merges</code> on the
files you are modifying to see the current conventions.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary-section" class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s customary to start the remainder of the first line after "area: "
with a lower-case letter. E.g. "doc: clarify&#8230;&#8203;", not "doc:
Clarify&#8230;&#8203;", or "githooks.txt: improve&#8230;&#8203;", not "githooks.txt:
Improve&#8230;&#8203;".</p>
</div>
<div id="meaningful-message" class="paragraph">
<p>The body should provide a meaningful commit message, which:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>explains the problem the change tries to solve, i.e. what is wrong
with the current code without the change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>justifies the way the change solves the problem, i.e. why the
result with the change is better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alternate solutions considered but discarded, if any.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="imperative-mood" class="paragraph">
<p>Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz"
instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy
to do frotz", as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change
its behavior.  Try to make sure your explanation can be understood
without external resources. Instead of giving a URL to a mailing list
archive, summarize the relevant points of the discussion.</p>
</div>
<div id="commit-reference" class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to reference a previous commit in the history of a stable
branch, use the format "abbreviated hash (subject, date)", like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>	Commit f86a374 (pack-bitmap.c: fix a memleak, 2015-03-30)
	noticed that ...</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "Copy commit summary" command of gitk can be used to obtain this
format (with the subject enclosed in a pair of double-quotes), or this
invocation of <code>git show</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>	git show -s --pretty=reference &lt;commit&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>or, on an older version of Git without support for --pretty=reference:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>	git show -s --date=short --pretty='format:%h (%s, %ad)' &lt;commit&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="git-tools"><a class="anchor" href="#git-tools"></a>Generate your patch using Git tools out of your commits.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git based diff tools generate unidiff which is the preferred format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You do not have to be afraid to use <code>-M</code> option to <code>git diff</code> or
<code>git format-patch</code>, if your patch involves file renames.  The
receiving end can handle them just fine.</p>
</div>
<div id="review-patch" class="paragraph">
<p>Please make sure your patch does not add commented out debugging code,
or include any extra files which do not relate to what your patch
is trying to achieve. Make sure to review
your patch after generating it, to ensure accuracy.  Before
sending out, please make sure it cleanly applies to the <code>master</code>
branch head.  If you are preparing a work based on "next" branch,
that is fine, but please mark it as such.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="send-patches"><a class="anchor" href="#send-patches"></a>Sending your patches.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before sending any patches, please note that patches that may be
security relevant should be submitted privately to the Git Security
mailing list<sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_security-ml">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>, instead of the public mailing list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learn to use format-patch and send-email if possible.  These commands
are optimized for the workflow of sending patches, avoiding many ways
your existing e-mail client that is optimized for "multipart/*" mime
type e-mails to corrupt and render your patches unusable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People on the Git mailing list need to be able to read and
comment on the changes you are submitting.  It is important for
a developer to be able to "quote" your changes, using standard
e-mail tools, so that they may comment on specific portions of
your code.  For this reason, each patch should be submitted
"inline" in a separate message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multiple related patches should be grouped into their own e-mail
thread to help readers find all parts of the series.  To that end,
send them as replies to either an additional "cover letter" message
(see below), the first patch, or the respective preceding patch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your log message (including your name on the
<code>Signed-off-by</code> trailer) is not writable in ASCII, make sure that
you send off a message in the correct encoding.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock warning">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Warning</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
Be wary of your MUAs word-wrap
corrupting your patch.  Do not cut-n-paste your patch; you can
lose tabs that way if you are not careful.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is a common convention to prefix your subject line with
[PATCH].  This lets people easily distinguish patches from other
e-mail discussions.  Use of markers in addition to PATCH within
the brackets to describe the nature of the patch is also
encouraged.  E.g. [RFC PATCH] (where RFC stands for "request for
comments") is often used to indicate a patch needs further
discussion before being accepted, [PATCH v2], [PATCH v3] etc.
are often seen when you are sending an update to what you have
previously sent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git format-patch</code> command follows the best current practice to
format the body of an e-mail message.  At the beginning of the
patch should come your commit message, ending with the
<code>Signed-off-by</code> trailers, and a line that consists of three dashes,
followed by the diffstat information and the patch itself.  If
you are forwarding a patch from somebody else, optionally, at
the beginning of the e-mail message just before the commit
message starts, you can put a "From: " line to name that person.
To change the default "[PATCH]" in the subject to "[&lt;text&gt;]", use
<code>git format-patch --subject-prefix=&lt;text&gt;</code>.  As a shortcut, you
can use <code>--rfc</code> instead of <code>--subject-prefix="RFC PATCH"</code>, or
<code>-v &lt;n&gt;</code> instead of <code>--subject-prefix="PATCH v&lt;n&gt;"</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You often want to add additional explanation about the patch,
other than the commit message itself.  Place such "cover letter"
material between the three-dash line and the diffstat.  For
patches requiring multiple iterations of review and discussion,
an explanation of changes between each iteration can be kept in
Git-notes and inserted automatically following the three-dash
line via <code>git format-patch --notes</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="attachment" class="paragraph">
<p>Do not attach the patch as a MIME attachment, compressed or not.
Do not let your e-mail client send quoted-printable.  Do not let
your e-mail client send format=flowed which would destroy
whitespaces in your patches. Many
popular e-mail applications will not always transmit a MIME
attachment as plain text, making it impossible to comment on
your code.  A MIME attachment also takes a bit more time to
process.  This does not decrease the likelihood of your
MIME-attached change being accepted, but it makes it more likely
that it will be postponed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Exception:  If your mailer is mangling patches then someone may ask
you to re-send them using MIME, that is OK.</p>
</div>
<div id="pgp-signature" class="paragraph">
<p>Do not PGP sign your patch. Most likely, your maintainer or other people on the
list would not have your PGP key and would not bother obtaining it anyway.
Your patch is not judged by who you are; a good patch from an unknown origin
has a far better chance of being accepted than a patch from a known, respected
origin that is done poorly or does incorrect things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you really really really really want to do a PGP signed
patch, format it as "multipart/signed", not a text/plain message
that starts with <code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----</code>.  That is
not a text/plain, it&#8217;s something else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned at the beginning of the section, patches that may be
security relevant should not be submitted to the public mailing list
mentioned below, but should instead be sent privately to the Git
Security mailing list<sup class="footnoteref">[<a class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Send your patch with "To:" set to the mailing list, with "cc:" listing
people who are involved in the area you are touching (the <code>git
contacts</code> command in <code>contrib/contacts/</code> can help to
identify them), to solicit comments and reviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the list reached a consensus that it is a good idea to apply the
patch, re-send it with "To:" set to the maintainer<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>
and "cc:" the list<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup> for inclusion.  This is especially relevant
when the maintainer did not heavily participate in the discussion and
instead left the review to trusted others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not forget to add trailers such as <code>Acked-by:</code>, <code>Reviewed-by:</code> and
<code>Tested-by:</code> lines as necessary to credit people who helped your
patch, and "cc:" them when sending such a final version for inclusion.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sign-off"><a class="anchor" href="#sign-off"></a>Certify your work by adding your <code>Signed-off-by</code> trailer</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To improve tracking of who did what, we ask you to certify that you
wrote the patch or have the right to pass it on under the same license
as ours, by "signing off" your patch.  Without sign-off, we cannot
accept your patches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you can certify the below D-C-O:</p>

<p>you add a "Signed-off-by" trailer to your commit, that looks like
this:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that you can place your own <code>Signed-off-by</code> trailer when
forwarding somebody else&#8217;s patch with the above rules for
D-C-O.  Indeed you are encouraged to do so.  Do not forget to
place an in-body "From: " line at the beginning to properly attribute
the change to its true author (see (2) above).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This procedure originally came from the Linux kernel project, so our
rule is quite similar to theirs, but what exactly it means to sign-off
your patch differs from project to project, so it may be different
from that of the project you are accustomed to.</p>

the patch attempts to modify liked the patch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Reviewed-by:</code>, unlike the other tags, can only be offered by the
reviewer and means that she is completely satisfied that the patch

    Fix pine whitespace-corruption bug

    There's no excuse for unconditionally removing whitespace from
    the pico buffers on close.

<pre>&gt; A patch to SubmittingPatches, MUA specific help section for
&gt; users of Pine 4.63 would be very much appreciated.

Ah, it looks like a recent version changed the default behavior to do the
right thing, and inverted the sense of the configuration option. (Either
that or Gentoo did it.) So you need to set the
"no-strip-whitespace-before-send" option, unless the option you have is
"strip-whitespace-before-send", in which case you should avoid checking
it.</pre>

<p>"|" in the <code>*Summary*</code> buffer can be used to pipe the current
message to an external program, and this is a handy way to drive
<code>git am</code>.  However, if the message is MIME encoded, what is
piped into the program is the representation you see in your
<code>*Article*</code> buffer after unwrapping MIME.  This is often not what
you would want for two reasons.  It tends to screw up non ASCII
characters (most notably in people&#8217;s names), and also
whitespaces (fatal in patches).  Running "C-u g" to display the
message in raw form before using "|" to run the pipe can work
this problem around.</p>
