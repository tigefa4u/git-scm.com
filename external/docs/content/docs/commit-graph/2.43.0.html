<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git walks the commit graph for many reasons, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Listing and filtering commit history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computing merge bases.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These operations can become slow as the commit count grows. The merge
base calculation shows up in many user-facing commands, such as <em>merge-base</em>
or <em>status</em> and can take minutes to compute depending on history shape.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two main costs here:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Decompressing and parsing commits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walking the entire graph to satisfy topological order constraints.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The commit-graph file is a supplemental data structure that accelerates
commit graph walks. If a user downgrades or disables the <em>core.commitGraph</em>
config setting, then the existing object database is sufficient. The file is stored
as "commit-graph" either in the .git/objects/info directory or in the info
directory of an alternate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The commit-graph file stores the commit graph structure along with some
extra metadata to speed up graph walks. By listing commit OIDs in
lexicographic order, we can identify an integer position for each commit
and refer to the parents of a commit using those integer positions. We
use binary search to find initial commits and then use the integer
positions for fast lookups during the walk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A consumer may load the following info for a commit from the graph:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The commit OID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list of parents, along with their integer position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commit date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The root tree OID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The generation number (see definition below).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Values 1-4 satisfy the requirements of parse_commit_gently().</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two definitions of generation number:
1. Corrected committer dates (generation number v2)
2. Topological levels (generation number v1)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Define "corrected committer date" of a commit recursively as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A commit with no parents (a root commit) has corrected committer date
equal to its committer date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A commit with at least one parent has corrected committer date equal to
the maximum of its committer date and one more than the largest corrected
committer date among its parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a special case, a root commit with timestamp zero has corrected commit
date of 1, to be able to distinguish it from GENERATION_NUMBER_ZERO
(that is, an uncomputed corrected commit date).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Define the "topological level" of a commit recursively as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A commit with no parents (a root commit) has topological level of one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A commit with at least one parent has topological level one more than
the largest topological level among its parents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Equivalently, the topological level of a commit A is one more than the
length of a longest path from A to a root commit. The recursive definition
is easier to use for computation and observing the following property:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>If A and B are commits with generation numbers N and M, respectively,
and N &lt;= M, then A cannot reach B. That is, we know without searching
that B is not an ancestor of A because it is further from a root commit
than A.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Conversely, when checking if A is an ancestor of B, then we only need
to walk commits until all commits on the walk boundary have generation
number at most N. If we walk commits using a priority queue seeded by
generation numbers, then we always expand the boundary commit with highest
generation number and can easily detect the stopping condition.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The property applies to both versions of generation number, that is both
corrected committer dates and topological levels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This property can be used to significantly reduce the time it takes to
walk commits and determine topological relationships. Without generation
numbers, the general heuristic is the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>If A and B are commits with commit time X and Y, respectively, and
X &lt; Y, then A _probably_ cannot reach B.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In absence of corrected commit dates (for example, old versions of Git or
mixed generation graph chains),
this heuristic is currently used whenever the computation is allowed to
violate topological relationships due to clock skew (such as "git log"
with default order), but is not used when the topological order is
required (such as merge base calculations, "git log --graph").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In practice, we expect some commits to be created recently and not stored
in the commit-graph. We can treat these commits as having "infinite"
generation number and walk until reaching commits with known generation
number.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use the macro GENERATION_NUMBER_INFINITY to mark commits not
in the commit-graph file. If a commit-graph file was written by a version
of Git that did not compute generation numbers, then those commits will
have generation number represented by the macro GENERATION_NUMBER_ZERO = 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the commit-graph file is closed under reachability, we can guarantee
the following weaker condition on all commits:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>If A and B are commits with generation numbers N and M, respectively,
and N &lt; M, then A cannot reach B.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note how the strict inequality differs from the inequality when we have
fully-computed generation numbers. Using strict inequality may result in
walking a few extra commits, but the simplicity in dealing with commits
with generation number *_INFINITY or *_ZERO is valuable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use the macro GENERATION_NUMBER_V1_MAX = 0x3FFFFFFF for commits whose
topological levels (generation number v1) are computed to be at least
this value. We limit at this value since it is the largest value that
can be stored in the commit-graph file using the 30 bits available
to topological levels. This presents another case where a commit can
have generation number equal to that of a parent.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The commit-graph file is stored in a file named <em>commit-graph</em> in the
.git/objects/info directory. This could be stored in the info directory
of an alternate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The core.commitGraph config setting must be on to consume graph files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The file format includes parameters for the object ID hash function,
so a future change of hash algorithm does not require a change in format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commit grafts and replace objects can change the shape of the commit
history. The latter can also be enabled/disabled on the fly using
<code>--no-replace-objects</code>. This leads to difficulty storing both possible
interpretations of a commit id, especially when computing generation
numbers. The commit-graph will not be read or written when
replace-objects or grafts are present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shallow clones create grafts of commits by dropping their parents. This
leads the commit-graph to think those commits have generation number 1.
If and when those commits are made unshallow, those generation numbers
become invalid. Since shallow clones are intended to restrict the commit
history to a very small set of commits, the commit-graph feature is less
helpful for these clones, anyway. The commit-graph will not be read or
written when shallow commits are present.</p>

<p>Typically, repos grow with near-constant velocity (commits per day). Over time,
the number of commits added by a fetch operation is much smaller than the
number of commits in the full history. By creating a "chain" of commit-graphs,
we enable fast writes of new commit data without rewriting the entire commit
history&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;at least, most of the time.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A commit-graph chain uses multiple files, and we use a fixed naming convention
to organize these files. Each commit-graph file has a name
<code>$OBJDIR/info/commit-graphs/graph-{hash}.graph</code> where <code>{hash}</code> is the hex-
valued hash stored in the footer of that file (which is a hash of the file&#8217;s
contents before that hash). For a chain of commit-graph files, a plain-text
file at <code>$OBJDIR/info/commit-graphs/commit-graph-chain</code> contains the
hashes for the files in order from "lowest" to "highest".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if the <code>commit-graph-chain</code> file contains the lines</p>

then we interpret this as being the commit in position (X0 + X1 + i), and that
will be used as its "graph position". The commits in <code>graph-{hash2}.graph</code> use these
positions to refer to their parents, which may be in <code>graph-{hash1}.graph</code> or

<h2 id="_merge_strategy"><a class="anchor" href="#_merge_strategy"></a>Merge Strategy</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When writing a set of commits that do not exist in the commit-graph stack of
height N, we default to creating a new file at level N + 1. We then decide to
merge with the Nth level if one of two conditions hold:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><code>--size-multiple=&lt;X&gt;</code> is specified or X = 2, and the number of commits in
level N is less than X times the number of commits in level N + 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--max-commits=&lt;C&gt;</code> is specified with non-zero C and the number of commits
in level N + 1 is more than C commits.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This decision cascades down the levels: when we merge a level we create a new
set of commits that then compares to the next level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first condition bounds the number of levels to be logarithmic in the total
number of commits.  The second condition bounds the total number of commits in
a <code>graph-{hashN}</code> file and not in the <code>commit-graph</code> file, preventing
significant performance issues when the stack merges and another process only
partially reads the previous stack.</p>

<h2 id="_handling_mixed_generation_number_chains"><a class="anchor" href="#_handling_mixed_generation_number_chains"></a>Handling Mixed Generation Number Chains</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the introduction of generation number v2 and generation data chunk, the
following scenario is possible:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>"New" Git writes a commit-graph with the corrected commit dates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Old" Git writes a split commit-graph on top without corrected commit dates.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A naive approach of using the newest available generation number from
each layer would lead to violated expectations: the lower layer would
use corrected commit dates which are much larger than the topological
levels of the higher layer. For this reason, Git inspects the topmost
layer to see if the layer is missing corrected commit dates. In such a case
Git only uses topological level for generation numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When writing a new layer in split commit-graph, we write corrected commit
dates if the topmost layer has corrected commit dates written. This
guarantees that if a layer has corrected commit dates, all lower layers
must have corrected commit dates as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When merging layers, we do not consider whether the merged layers had corrected
commit dates. Instead, the new layer will have corrected commit dates if the
layer below the new layer has corrected commit dates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While writing or merging layers, if the new layer is the only layer, it will
have corrected commit dates when written by compatible versions of Git. Thus,
rewriting split commit-graph as a single file (<code>--split=replace</code>) creates a
single layer with corrected commit dates.</p>

<h2 id="_deleting_graph_hash_files"><a class="anchor" href="#_deleting_graph_hash_files"></a>Deleting graph-{hash} files</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a new tip file is written, some <code>graph-{hash}</code> files may no longer
be part of a chain. It is important to remove these files from disk, eventually.
The main reason to delay removal is that another process could read the
<code>commit-graph-chain</code> file before it is rewritten, but then look for the
<code>graph-{hash}</code> files after they are deleted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To allow holding old split commit-graphs for a while after they are unreferenced,
we update the modified times of the files when they become unreferenced. Then,
we scan the <code>$OBJDIR/info/commit-graphs/</code> directory for <code>graph-{hash}</code>
files whose modified times are older than a given expiry window. This window
defaults to zero, but can be changed using command-line arguments or a config
setting.</p>

<h2 id="_chains_across_multiple_object_directories"><a class="anchor" href="#_chains_across_multiple_object_directories"></a>Chains across multiple object directories</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a repo with alternates, we look for the <code>commit-graph-chain</code> file starting
in the local object directory and then in each alternate. The first file that
exists defines our chain. As we look for the <code>graph-{hash}</code> files for
each <code>{hash}</code> in the chain file, we follow the same pattern for the host
directories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This allows commit-graphs to be split across multiple forks in a fork network.
The typical case is a large "base" repo with many smaller forks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the base repo advances, it will likely update and merge its commit-graph
chain more frequently than the forks. If a fork updates their commit-graph after
the base repo, then it should "reparent" the commit-graph chain onto the new
chain in the base repo. When reading each <code>graph-{hash}</code> file, we track
the object directory containing it. During a write of a new commit-graph file,
we check for any changes in the source object directory and read the
<code>commit-graph-chain</code> file for that source and create a new file based on those
files. During this "reparent" operation, we necessarily need to collapse all
levels in the fork, as all of the files are invalid against the new base file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is crucial to be careful when cleaning up "unreferenced" <code>graph-{hash}.graph</code>
files in this scenario. It falls to the user to define the proper settings for
their custom environment:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>When merging levels in the base repo, the unreferenced files may still be
referenced by chains from fork repos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The expiry time should be set to a length of time such that every fork has
time to recompute their commit-graph chain to "reparent" onto the new base
file(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the commit-graph chain is updated in the base, the fork will not have
access to the new chain until its chain is updated to reference those files.
