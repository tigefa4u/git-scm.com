<p>Here are some guidelines for contributing back to this
project. There is also a <a href="{{< relurl "docs/MyFirstContribution" >}}">step-by-step tutorial</a>
available which covers many of these same guidelines.</p>

<h3 id="patch-flow"><a class="anchor" href="#patch-flow"></a>A typical life cycle of a patch series</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To help us understand the reason behind various guidelines given later
in the document, first let&#8217;s understand how the life cycle of a
typical patch series for this project goes.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>You come up with an itch.  You code it up.  You do not need any
pre-authorization from the project to do so.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your patches will be reviewed by other contributors on the mailing
list, and the reviews will be done to assess the merit of various
things, like the general idea behind your patch (including "is it
solving a problem worth solving in the first place?"), the reason
behind the design of the solution, and the actual implementation.
The guidelines given here are there to help your patches by making
them easier to understand by the reviewers.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You send the patches to the list and cc people who may need to know
about the change.  Your goal is <strong>not</strong> necessarily to convince others
that what you are building is good.  Your goal is to get help in
coming up with a solution for the "itch" that is better than what
you can build alone.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The people who may need to know are the ones who worked on the code
you are touching.  These people happen to be the ones who are
most likely to be knowledgeable enough to help you, but
they have no obligation to help you (i.e. you ask them for help,
you don&#8217;t demand).  <code>git log -p &#x2d;&#x2d; <em>$area_you_are_modifying</em></code> would
help you find out who they are.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You get comments and suggestions for improvements.  You may even get
them in an "on top of your change" patch form.  You are expected to
respond to them with "Reply-All" on the mailing list, while taking
them into account while preparing an updated set of patches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polish, refine, and re-send your patches to the list and to the people
who spent their time to improve your patch.  Go back to step (2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the above iterations improve your patches, the maintainer may
pick the patches up from the list and queue them to the <code>seen</code>
branch, in order to make it easier for people to play with it
without having to pick up and apply the patches to their trees
themselves.  Being in <code>seen</code> has no other meaning.  Specifically, it
does not mean the patch was "accepted" in any way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the discussion reaches a consensus that the latest iteration of
the patches are in good enough shape, the maintainer includes the
topic in the "What&#8217;s cooking" report that are sent out a few times a
week to the mailing list, marked as "Will merge to <em>next</em>."  This
decision is primarily made by the maintainer with help from those
who participated in the review discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the patches are merged to the <em>next</em> branch, the discussion
can still continue to further improve them by adding more patches on
top, but by the time a topic gets merged to <em>next</em>, it is expected
that everybody agrees that the scope and the basic direction of the
topic are appropriate, so such an incremental updates are limited to
small corrections and polishing.  After a topic cooks for some time
(like 7 calendar days) in <em>next</em> without needing further tweaks on
top, it gets merged to the <em>master</em> branch and wait to become part
of the next major release.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the following sections, many techniques and conventions are listed
to help your patches get reviewed effectively in such a life cycle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="choose-starting-point"><a class="anchor" href="#choose-starting-point"></a>Choose a starting point.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a preliminary step, you must first choose a starting point for your
work. Typically this means choosing a branch, although technically
speaking it is actually a particular commit (typically the HEAD, or tip,
of the branch).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several important branches to be aware of. Namely, there are
four integration branches as discussed in <a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitworkflows" >}}'>gitworkflows[7]</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>maint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>master</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>next</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seen</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The branches lower on the list are typically descendants of the ones
that come before it. For example, <code>maint</code> is an "older" branch than
<code>master</code> because <code>master</code> usually has patches (commits) on top of
<code>maint</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also "topic" branches, which contain work from other
contributors.  Topic branches are created by the Git maintainer (in
their fork) to organize the current set of incoming contributions on
the mailing list, and are itemized in the regular "What&#8217;s cooking in
git.git" announcements.  To find the tip of a topic branch, run <code>git log
--first-parent master..seen</code> and look for the merge commit. The second
parent of this commit is the tip of the topic branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is one guiding principle for choosing the right starting point: in
general, always base your work on the oldest integration branch that
your change is relevant to (see "Merge upwards" in
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/gitworkflows" >}}'>gitworkflows[7]</a>).  What this principle means is that for the
vast majority of cases, the starting point for new work should be the
latest HEAD commit of <code>maint</code> or <code>master</code> based on the following cases:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are fixing bugs in the released version, use <code>maint</code> as the
starting point (which may mean you have to fix things without using
new API features on the cutting edge that recently appeared in
<code>master</code> but were not available in the released version).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise (such as if you are adding new features) use <code>master</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
In exceptional cases, a bug that was introduced in an old
version may have to be fixed for users of releases that are much older
than the recent releases.  <code>git describe --contains X</code> may describe
<code>X</code> as <code>v2.30.0-rc2-gXXXXXX</code> for the commit <code>X</code> that introduced the
bug, and the bug may be so high-impact that we may need to issue a new
maintenance release for Git 2.30.x series, when "Git 2.41.0" is the
current release.  In such a case, you may want to use the tip of the
maintenance branch for the 2.30.x series, which may be available in the
<code>maint-2.30</code> branch in <a href="https://github.com/gitster/git">the maintainer&#8217;s
"broken out" repo</a>.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This also means that <code>next</code> or <code>seen</code> are inappropriate starting points
for your work, if you want your work to have a realistic chance of
graduating to <code>master</code>.  They are simply not designed to be used as a
base for new work; they are only there to make sure that topics in
flight work well together. This is why both <code>next</code> and <code>seen</code> are
frequently re-integrated with incoming patches on the mailing list and
force-pushed to replace previous versions of themselves. A topic that is
literally built on top of <code>next</code> cannot be merged to <code>master</code> without
dragging in all the other topics in <code>next</code>, some of which may not be
ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if you are making tree-wide changes, while somebody else is
also making their own tree-wide changes, your work may have severe
overlap with the other person&#8217;s work.  This situation may tempt you to
use <code>next</code> as your starting point (because it would have the other
person&#8217;s work included in it), but doing so would mean you&#8217;ll not only
depend on the other person&#8217;s work, but all the other random things from
other contributors that are already integrated into <code>next</code>.  And as soon
as <code>next</code> is updated with a new version, all of your work will need to
be rebased anyway in order for them to be cleanly applied by the
maintainer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under truly exceptional circumstances where you absolutely must depend
on a select few topic branches that are already in <code>next</code> but not in
<code>master</code>, you may want to create your own custom base-branch by forking
<code>master</code> and merging the required topic branches into it. You could then
work on top of this base-branch.  But keep in mind that this base-branch
would only be known privately to you.  So when you are ready to send
your patches to the list, be sure to communicate how you created it in
your cover letter.  This critical piece of information would allow
others to recreate your base-branch on their end in order for them to
try out your work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, note that some parts of the system have dedicated maintainers
with their own separate source code repositories (see the section
"Subsystems" below).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="separate-commits"><a class="anchor" href="#separate-commits"></a>Make separate commits for logically separate changes.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unless your patch is really trivial, you should not be sending
out a patch that was generated between your working tree and
your commit head.  Instead, always make a commit with complete
commit message and generate a series of patches from your
repository.  It is a good discipline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Give an explanation for the change(s) that is detailed enough so
that people can judge if it is good thing to do, without reading
the actual patch text to determine how well the code does what
the explanation promises to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your description starts to get too long, that&#8217;s a sign that you
probably need to split up your commit to finer grained pieces.
That being said, patches which plainly describe the things that
help reviewers check the patch, and future maintainers understand
the code, are the most beautiful patches.  Descriptions that summarize
the point in the subject well, and describe the motivation for the
change, the approach taken by the change, and if relevant how this
differs substantially from the prior version, are all good things
to have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure that you have tests for the bug you are fixing.  See
<code>t/README</code> for guidance.</p>
</div>
<div id="tests" class="paragraph">
<p>When adding a new feature, make sure that you have new tests to show
the feature triggers the new behavior when it should, and to show the
feature does not trigger when it shouldn&#8217;t.  After any code change,
make sure that the entire test suite passes.  When fixing a bug, make
sure you have new tests that break if somebody else breaks what you
fixed by accident to avoid regression.  Also, try merging your work to
<em>next</em> and <em>seen</em> and make sure the tests still pass; topics by others
that are still in flight may have unexpected interactions with what
you are trying to do in your topic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pushing to a fork of <a href="https://github.com/git/git" class="bare">https://github.com/git/git</a> will use their CI
integration to test your changes on Linux, Mac and Windows. See the
<a href="#GHCI">GitHub CI</a> section for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not forget to update the documentation to describe the updated
behavior and make sure that the resulting documentation set formats
well (try the Documentation/doc-diff script).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We currently have a liberal mixture of US and UK English norms for
spelling and grammar, which is somewhat unfortunate.  A huge patch that
touches the files all over the place only to correct the inconsistency
is not welcome, though.  Potential clashes with other changes that can
result from such a patch are not worth it.  We prefer to gradually
reconcile the inconsistencies in favor of US English, with small and
easily digestible patches, as a side effect of doing some other real
work in the vicinity (e.g. rewriting a paragraph for clarity, while
turning en_UK spelling to en_US).  Obvious typographical fixes are much
more welcomed ("teh &#8594; "the"), preferably submitted as independent
patches separate from other documentation changes.</p>
</div>
<div id="whitespace-check" class="paragraph">
<p>Oh, another thing.  We are picky about whitespaces.  Make sure your
changes do not trigger errors with the sample pre-commit hook shipped
in <code>templates/hooks--pre-commit</code>.  To help ensure this does not happen,
run <code>git diff --check</code> on your changes before you commit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="describe-changes"><a class="anchor" href="#describe-changes"></a>Describe your changes well.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The log message that explains your changes is just as important as the
changes themselves.  Your code may be clearly written with in-code
comment to sufficiently explain how it works with the surrounding
code, but those who need to fix or enhance your code in the future
will need to know <em>why</em> your code does what it does, for a few
reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Your code may be doing something differently from what you wanted it
to do.  Writing down what you actually wanted to achieve will help
them fix your code and make it do what it should have been doing
(also, you often discover your own bugs yourself, while writing the
log message to summarize the thought behind it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your code may be doing things that were only necessary for your
immediate needs (e.g. "do X to directories" without implementing or
even designing what is to be done on files).  Writing down why you
excluded what the code does not do will help guide future developers.
Writing down "we do X to directories, because directories have
characteristic Y" would help them infer "oh, files also have the same
characteristic Y, so perhaps doing X to them would also make sense?".
Saying "we don&#8217;t do the same X to files, because &#8230;&#8203;" will help them
decide if the reasoning is sound (in which case they do not waste
time extending your code to cover files), or reason differently (in
which case, they can explain why they extend your code to cover
files, too).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of your log message is to convey the <em>why</em> behind your change
to help future developers.  The reviewers will also make sure that
your proposed log message will serve this purpose well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first line of the commit message should be a short description (50
characters is the soft limit, see DISCUSSION in <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-commit" >}}'>git-commit[1]</a>),
and should skip the full stop.  It is also conventional in most cases to
prefix the first line with "area: " where the area is a filename or
identifier for the general area of the code being modified, e.g.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>doc: clarify distinction between sign-off and pgp-signing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>githooks.txt: improve the intro section</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If in doubt which identifier to use, run <code>git log --no-merges</code> on the
files you are modifying to see the current conventions.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary-section" class="paragraph">
<p>The title sentence after the "area:" prefix omits the full stop at the
end, and its first word is not capitalized (the omission
of capitalization applies only to the word after the "area:"
prefix of the title) unless there is a reason to
capitalize it other than because it is the first word in the sentence.
E.g. "doc: clarify&#8230;&#8203;", not "doc: Clarify&#8230;&#8203;", or "githooks.txt:
improve&#8230;&#8203;", not "githooks.txt: Improve&#8230;&#8203;".  But "refs: HEAD is also
treated as a ref" is correct, as we spell <code>HEAD</code> in all caps even when
it appears in the middle of a sentence.</p>
</div>
<div id="meaningful-message" class="paragraph">
<p>The body should provide a meaningful commit message, which:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>explains the problem the change tries to solve, i.e. what is wrong
with the current code without the change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>justifies the way the change solves the problem, i.e. why the
result with the change is better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alternate solutions considered but discarded, if any.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="present-tense" class="paragraph">
<p>The problem statement that describes the status quo is written in the
present tense.  Write "The code does X when it is given input Y",
instead of "The code used to do Y when given input X".  You do not
have to say "Currently"---the status quo in the problem statement is
about the code <em>without</em> your change, by project convention.</p>
</div>
<div id="imperative-mood" class="paragraph">
<p>Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz"
instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy
to do frotz", as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change
its behavior.  Try to make sure your explanation can be understood
without external resources. Instead of giving a URL to a mailing list
archive, summarize the relevant points of the discussion.</p>
</div>
<div id="commit-reference" class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few reasons why you may want to refer to another commit in
the "more stable" part of the history (i.e. on branches like <code>maint</code>,
<code>master</code>, and <code>next</code>):</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A commit that introduced the root cause of a bug you are fixing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A commit that introduced a feature that you are enhancing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A commit that conflicts with your work when you made a trial merge
of your work into <code>next</code> and <code>seen</code> for testing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you reference a commit on a more stable branch (like <code>master</code>,
<code>maint</code> and <code>next</code>), use the format "abbreviated hash (subject,
date)", like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>	Commit f86a374 (pack-bitmap.c: fix a memleak, 2015-03-30)

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "Copy commit reference" command of gitk can be used to obtain this
format (with the subject enclosed in a pair of double-quotes), or this
invocation of <code>git show</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>	git show -s --pretty=reference &lt;commit&gt;</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is a common convention to prefix your subject line with
[PATCH].  This lets people easily distinguish patches from other
e-mail discussions.  Use of markers in addition to PATCH within
the brackets to describe the nature of the patch is also
encouraged.  E.g. [RFC PATCH] (where RFC stands for "request for
comments") is often used to indicate a patch needs further
discussion before being accepted, [PATCH v2], [PATCH v3] etc.
are often seen when you are sending an update to what you have
previously sent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git format-patch</code> command follows the best current practice to
format the body of an e-mail message.  At the beginning of the
patch should come your commit message, ending with the
<code>Signed-off-by</code> trailers, and a line that consists of three dashes,
followed by the diffstat information and the patch itself.  If
you are forwarding a patch from somebody else, optionally, at
the beginning of the e-mail message just before the commit
message starts, you can put a "From: " line to name that person.
To change the default "[PATCH]" in the subject to "[&lt;text&gt;]", use
<code>git format-patch --subject-prefix=&lt;text&gt;</code>.  As a shortcut, you
can use <code>--rfc</code> instead of <code>--subject-prefix="RFC PATCH"</code>, or
<code>-v &lt;n&gt;</code> instead of <code>--subject-prefix="PATCH v&lt;n&gt;"</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You often want to add additional explanation about the patch,
other than the commit message itself.  Place such "cover letter"
material between the three-dash line and the diffstat.  For
patches requiring multiple iterations of review and discussion,
an explanation of changes between each iteration can be kept in
Git-notes and inserted automatically following the three-dash
line via <code>git format-patch --notes</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-topic-summary" class="paragraph">
<p><strong>This is EXPERIMENTAL</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When sending a topic, you can propose a one-paragraph summary that
should appear in the "What&#8217;s cooking" report when it is picked up to
explain the topic.  If you choose to do so, please write a 2-5 line
paragraph that will fit well in our release notes (see many bulleted
entries in the Documentation/RelNotes/* files for examples), and make
it the first paragraph of the cover letter.  For a single-patch
series, use the space between the three-dash line and the diffstat, as
described earlier.</p>
</div>
<div id="attachment" class="paragraph">
<p>Do not attach the patch as a MIME attachment, compressed or not.
Do not let your e-mail client send quoted-printable.  Do not let
your e-mail client send format=flowed which would destroy
whitespaces in your patches. Many
popular e-mail applications will not always transmit a MIME
attachment as plain text, making it impossible to comment on
your code.  A MIME attachment also takes a bit more time to
process.  This does not decrease the likelihood of your
MIME-attached change being accepted, but it makes it more likely
that it will be postponed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Exception:  If your mailer is mangling patches then someone may ask
you to re-send them using MIME, that is OK.</p>
</div>
<div id="pgp-signature" class="paragraph">
<p>Do not PGP sign your patch. Most likely, your maintainer or other people on the
list would not have your PGP key and would not bother obtaining it anyway.
Your patch is not judged by who you are; a good patch from an unknown origin
has a far better chance of being accepted than a patch from a known, respected
origin that is done poorly or does incorrect things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you really really really really want to do a PGP signed
patch, format it as "multipart/signed", not a text/plain message
that starts with <code>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----</code>.  That is
not a text/plain, it&#8217;s something else.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When revising changes made to your patches, it&#8217;s important to
acknowledge the possibility of conflicts with other ongoing topics. To
navigate these potential conflicts effectively, follow the recommended
steps outlined below:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Build on a suitable base branch, see the <a href="#choose-starting-point">section above</a>,
and format-patch the series. If you are doing "rebase -i" in-place to
update from the previous round, this will reuse the previous base so
(2) and (3) may become trivial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the base of where the last round was queued</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ mine='kn/ref-transaction-symref'
$ git checkout "origin/seen^{/^Merge branch '$mine'}...master"</pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply your format-patch result.  There are two cases</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Things apply cleanly and tests fine.  Go to (4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Things apply cleanly but does not build or test fails, or things do
not apply cleanly.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the latter case, you have textual or semantic conflicts coming from
the difference between the old base and the base you used to build in
(1).  Identify what caused the breakages (e.g., a topic or two may have
merged since the base used by (2) until the base used by (1)).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Check out the latest <em>origin/master</em> (which may be newer than the base
used by (2)), "merge --no-ff" the topics you newly depend on in there,
and use the result of the merge(s) as the base, rebuild the series and
test again.  Run format-patch from the last such merges to the tip of
your topic.  If you did</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git checkout origin/master
$ git merge --no-ff --into-name kn/ref-transaction-symref fo/obar
$ git merge --no-ff --into-name kn/ref-transaction-symref ba/zqux
... rebuild the topic ...</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then you&#8217;d just format your topic above these "preparing the ground"
merges, e.g.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git format-patch "HEAD^{/^Merge branch 'ba/zqux'}"..HEAD</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not forget to write in the cover letter you did this, including the
topics you have in your base on top of <em>master</em>.  Then go to (4).</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a trial merge of your topic into <em>next</em> and <em>seen</em>, e.g.</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git checkout --detach 'origin/seen'
$ git revert -m 1 &lt;the merge of the previous iteration into seen&gt;
$ git merge kn/ref-transaction-symref</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "revert" is needed if the previous iteration of your topic is
already in <em>seen</em> (like in this case).  You could choose to rebuild
master..origin/seen from scratch while excluding your previous
iteration, which may emulate what happens on the maintainers end more
closely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This trial merge may conflict.  It is primarily to see what conflicts
<em>other</em> topics may have with your topic.  In other words, you do not
have to depend on it to make your topic work on <em>master</em>.  It may
become the job of the other topic owners to resolve conflicts if your
topic goes to <em>next</em> before theirs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make a note on what conflict you saw in the cover letter.  You do not
necessarily have to resolve them, but it would be a good opportunity to
learn what others are doing in related areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git checkout --detach 'origin/next'
$ git merge kn/ref-transaction-symref</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is to see what conflicts your topic has with other topics that are
already cooking.  This should not conflict if (3)-2 prepared a base on
top of updated master plus dependent topics taken from <em>next</em>.  Unless
the context is severe (one way to tell is try the same trial merge with
your old iteration, which may conflict in a similar way), expect that it
will be handled on maintainers end (if it gets unmanageable, I&#8217;ll ask to
rebase when I receive your patches).</p>

Ah, it looks like a recent version changed the default behavior to do the
right thing, and inverted the sense of the configuration option. (Either
that or Gentoo did it.) So you need to set the
