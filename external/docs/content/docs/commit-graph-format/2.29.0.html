<p>The Git commit graph stores a list of commit OIDs and some associated
metadata, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The generation number of the commit. Commits with no parents have
generation number 1; commits with parents have generation number
one more than the maximum generation number of its parents. We
reserve zero as special, and can be used to mark a generation
number invalid or as "not computed".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The root tree OID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commit date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parents of the commit, stored using positional references within
the graph file.</p>

<li>
<p>The Bloom filter of the commit carrying the paths that were changed between
the commit and its first parent, if requested.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These positional references are stored as unsigned 32-bit integers
corresponding to the array position within the list of commit OIDs. Due
to some special constants we use to track parents, we can store at most
(1 &lt;&lt; 30) + (1 &lt;&lt; 29) + (1 &lt;&lt; 28) - 1 (around 1.8 billion) commits.</p>

    Other 8 bytes provide the byte-offset in current file for chunk to

    the length using the next chunk position if necessary.) Each chunk

<pre>OID Fanout (ID: {'O', 'I', 'D', 'F'}) (256 * 4 bytes)
    The ith entry, F[i], stores the number of OIDs with first

    number of commits (N).</pre>

<div class="content">
<pre>Commit Data (ID: {'C', 'D', 'A', 'T' }) (N * (H + 16) bytes)
  * The first H bytes are for the OID of the root tree.
  * The next 8 bytes are for the positions of the first two parents
    of the ith commit. Stores value 0x70000000 if no parent in that
    position. If there are more than two parents, the second value
    has its most-significant bit on and the other bits store an array
    position into the Extra Edge List chunk.
  * The next 8 bytes store the generation number of the commit and
    the commit time in seconds since EPOCH. The generation number
    uses the higher 30 bits of the first 4 bytes, while the commit
    time uses the 32 bits of the second 4 bytes, along with the lowest
    2 bits of the lowest byte, storing the 33rd and 34th bit of the
    commit time.</pre>

<div class="content">
<pre>Extra Edge List (ID: {'E', 'D', 'G', 'E'}) [Optional]
    This list of 4-byte values store the second through nth parents for
    all octopus merges. The second parent value in the commit data stores
    an array position within this list along with the most-significant bit
    on. Starting at that array position, iterate through this list of commit
    positions for the parents until reaching a value with the most-significant
    bit on. The other bits correspond to the position of the last parent.</pre>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Bloom Filter Index (ID: {'B', 'I', 'D', 'X'}) (N * 4 bytes) [Optional]
  * The ith entry, BIDX[i], stores the number of bytes in all Bloom filters
    from commit 0 to commit i (inclusive) in lexicographic order. The Bloom
    filter for the i-th commit spans from BIDX[i-1] to BIDX[i] (plus header
    length), where BIDX[-1] is 0.
  * The BIDX chunk is ignored if the BDAT chunk is not present.</pre>

<pre> Bloom Filter Data (ID: {'B', 'D', 'A', 'T'}) [Optional]
   * It starts with header consisting of three unsigned 32-bit integers:
     - Version of the hash algorithm being used. We currently only support
value 1 which corresponds to the 32-bit version of the murmur3 hash
implemented exactly as described in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash#Algorithm and the double
hashing technique using seed values 0x293ae76f and 0x7e646e2 as
described in https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-30494-4_26 "Bloom Filters
in Probabilistic Verification"
     - The number of times a path is hashed and hence the number of bit positions
      that cumulatively determine whether a file is present in the commit.
     - The minimum number of bits 'b' per entry in the Bloom filter. If the filter
      contains 'n' entries, then the filter size is the minimum number of 64-bit
      words that contain n*b bits.
   * The rest of the chunk is the concatenation of all the computed Bloom
     filters for the commits in lexicographic order.
   * Note: Commits with no changes or more than 512 changes have Bloom filters
     of length one, with either all bits set to zero or one respectively.
   * The BDAT chunk is present if and only if BIDX is present.</pre>

<pre>Base Graphs List (ID: {'B', 'A', 'S', 'E'}) [Optional]
    This list of H-byte hashes describe a set of B commit-graph files that
    form a commit-graph chain. The graph position for the ith commit in this
    file's OID Lookup chunk is equal to i plus the number of commits in all
    base graphs.  If B is non-zero, this chunk must exist.</pre>
