<p>New users are encouraged to use <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-log" >}}'>git-log[1]</a> instead.  The

but defaults to show the raw format diff output and to skip merges.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command is kept primarily for historical reasons; fingers of
many people who learned Git long before <code>git log</code> was invented by
reading Linux kernel mailing list are trained to type it.</p>
