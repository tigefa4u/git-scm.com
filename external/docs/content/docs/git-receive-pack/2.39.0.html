<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Invoked by <em>git send-pack</em> and updates the repository with the
information fed from the remote end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user.
The UI for the protocol is on the <em>git send-pack</em> side, and the
program pair is meant to be used to push updates to remote
repository.  For pull operations, see <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-fetch-pack" >}}'>git-fetch-pack[1]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command allows for creation and fast-forwarding of sha1 refs
(heads/tags) on the remote end (strictly speaking, it is the
local end <em>git-receive-pack</em> runs, but to the user who is sitting at
the send-pack end, it is updating the remote.  Confused?)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are other real-world examples of using update and
post-update hooks found in the Documentation/howto directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>git-receive-pack</em> honours the receive.denyNonFastForwards config
option, which tells it if updates to a ref should be denied if they
are not fast-forwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A number of other receive.* config options are available to tweak
its behavior, see <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-config" >}}'>git-config[1]</a>.</p>

each refname are the object names for the refname before and after
the update.  Refs to be created will have sha1-old equal to 0{40},

sha1-old and sha1-new should be valid objects in the repository.</p>

<p>This hook is called before any refname is updated and before any
fast-forward checks are performed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the pre-receive hook exits with a non-zero exit status no updates
will be performed, and the update, post-receive and post-update
hooks will not be invoked either.  This can be useful to quickly
bail out if the update is not to be supported.</p>

<h2 id="_update_hook"><a class="anchor" href="#_update_hook"></a>UPDATE HOOK</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before each ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/update file exists
and is executable, it is invoked once per ref, with three parameters:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$GIT_DIR/hooks/update refname sha1-old sha1-new</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The refname parameter is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master
head this is "refs/heads/master".  The two sha1 arguments are
the object names for the refname before and after the update.
Note that the hook is called before the refname is updated,
so either sha1-old is 0{40} (meaning there is no such ref yet),
or it should match what is recorded in refname.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hook should exit with non-zero status if it wants to disallow
updating the named ref.  Otherwise it should exit with zero.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Successful execution (a zero exit status) of this hook does not
ensure the ref will actually be updated, it is only a prerequisite.
As such it is not a good idea to send notices (e.g. email) from
this hook.  Consider using the post-receive hook instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_post_receive_hook"><a class="anchor" href="#_post_receive_hook"></a>POST-RECEIVE HOOK</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After all refs were updated (or attempted to be updated), if any
ref update was successful, and if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-receive
file exists and is executable, it will be invoked once with no
parameters.  The standard input of the hook will be one line
for each successfully updated ref:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF</pre>

<p>The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master

each refname are the object names for the refname before and after
the update.  Refs that were created will have sha1-old equal to
0{40}, while refs that were deleted will have sha1-new equal to
0{40}, otherwise sha1-old and sha1-new should be valid objects in
the repository.</p>

<p>The <code>GIT_PUSH_CERT*</code> environment variables can be inspected, just as
in <code>pre-receive</code> hook, after accepting a signed push.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using this hook, it is easy to generate mails describing the updates
to the repository.  This example script sends one mail message per
ref listing the commits pushed to the repository, and logs the push
certificates of signed pushes with good signatures to a logger
service:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored, however a
non-zero exit code will generate an error message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that it is possible for refname to not have sha1-new when this
hook runs.  This can easily occur if another user modifies the ref
after it was updated by <em>git-receive-pack</em>, but before the hook was able
to evaluate it.  It is recommended that hooks rely on sha1-new
rather than the current value of refname.</p>

<h2 id="_post_update_hook"><a class="anchor" href="#_post_update_hook"></a>POST-UPDATE HOOK</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After all other processing, if at least one ref was updated, and
if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-update file exists and is executable, then
post-update will be called with the list of refs that have been updated.
This can be used to implement any repository wide cleanup tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored; the only thing
left for <em>git-receive-pack</em> to do at that point is to exit itself
anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This hook can be used, for example, to run <code>git update-server-info</code>
if the repository is packed and is served via a dumb transport.</p>

<pre>#!/bin/sh

<h2 id="_quarantine_environment"><a class="anchor" href="#_quarantine_environment"></a>QUARANTINE ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When <code>receive-pack</code> takes in objects, they are placed into a temporary
"quarantine" directory within the <code>$GIT_DIR/objects</code> directory and
migrated into the main object store only after the <code>pre-receive</code> hook
has completed. If the push fails before then, the temporary directory is
removed entirely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This has a few user-visible effects and caveats:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Pushes which fail due to problems with the incoming pack, missing
objects, or due to the <code>pre-receive</code> hook will not leave any
on-disk data. This is usually helpful to prevent repeated failed
pushes from filling up your disk, but can make debugging more
challenging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any objects created by the <code>pre-receive</code> hook will be created in
the quarantine directory (and migrated only if it succeeds).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>pre-receive</code> hook MUST NOT update any refs to point to
quarantined objects. Other programs accessing the repository will
not be able to see the objects (and if the pre-receive hook fails,
those refs would become corrupted). For safety, any ref updates
from within <code>pre-receive</code> are automatically rejected.</p>
