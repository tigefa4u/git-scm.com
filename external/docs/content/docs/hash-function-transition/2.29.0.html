<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At its core, the Git version control system is a content addressable
filesystem. It uses the SHA-1 hash function to name content. For
example, files, directories, and revisions are referred to by hash
values unlike in other traditional version control systems where files
or versions are referred to via sequential numbers. The use of a hash
function to address its content delivers a few advantages:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Integrity checking is easy. Bit flips, for example, are easily
detected, as the hash of corrupted content does not match its name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lookup of objects is fast.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using a cryptographically secure hash function brings additional
advantages:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Object names can be signed and third parties can trust the hash to
address the signed object and all objects it references.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication using Git protocol and out of band communication
methods have a short reliable string that can be used to reliably
address stored content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over time some flaws in SHA-1 have been discovered by security
researchers. On 23 February 2017 the SHAttered attack
(<a href="https://shattered.io" class="bare">https://shattered.io</a>) demonstrated a practical SHA-1 hash collision.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git v2.13.0 and later subsequently moved to a hardened SHA-1
implementation by default, which isn&#8217;t vulnerable to the SHAttered
attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus Git has in effect already migrated to a new hash that isn&#8217;t SHA-1
and doesn&#8217;t share its vulnerabilities, its new hash function just
happens to produce exactly the same output for all known inputs,
except two PDFs published by the SHAttered researchers, and the new
implementation (written by those researchers) claims to detect future
cryptanalytic collision attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless, it&#8217;s considered prudent to move past any variant of SHA-1
to a new hash. There&#8217;s no guarantee that future attacks on SHA-1 won&#8217;t
be published in the future, and those attacks may not have viable
mitigations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If SHA-1 and its variants were to be truly broken, Git&#8217;s hash function
could not be considered cryptographically secure any more. This would
impact the communication of hash values because we could not trust
that a given hash value represented the known good version of content
that the speaker intended.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SHA-1 still possesses the other properties such as fast object lookup
and safe error checking, but other hash functions are equally suitable
that are believed to be cryptographically secure.</p>

<h2 id="_overview"><a class="anchor" href="#_overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We introduce a new repository format extension. Repositories with this
extension enabled use SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 to name their objects.
This affects both object names and object content --- both the names
of objects and all references to other objects within an object are
switched to the new hash function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SHA-256 repositories cannot be read by older versions of Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alongside the packfile, a SHA-256 repository stores a bidirectional
mapping between SHA-256 and SHA-1 object names. The mapping is generated
locally and can be verified using "git fsck". Object lookups use this
mapping to allow naming objects using either their SHA-1 and SHA-256 names
interchangeably.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"git cat-file" and "git hash-object" gain options to display an object
in its sha1 form and write an object given its sha1 form. This
requires all objects referenced by that object to be present in the
object database so that they can be named using the appropriate name
(using the bidirectional hash mapping).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fetches from a SHA-1 based server convert the fetched objects into
SHA-256 form and record the mapping in the bidirectional mapping table
(see below for details). Pushes to a SHA-1 based server convert the
objects being pushed into sha1 form so the server does not have to be
aware of the hash function the client is using.</p>

<p>A SHA-256 repository uses repository format version <code>1</code> (see

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Objects can be named by their 40 hexadecimal digit sha1-name or 64
hexadecimal digit sha256-name, plus names derived from those (see
gitrevisions(7)).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sha1-name of an object is the SHA-1 of the concatenation of its
type, length, a nul byte, and the object&#8217;s sha1-content. This is the
traditional &lt;sha1&gt; used in Git to name objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sha256-name of an object is the SHA-256 of the concatenation of its
type, length, a nul byte, and the object&#8217;s sha256-content.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_object_format"><a class="anchor" href="#_object_format"></a>Object format</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The content as a byte sequence of a tag, commit, or tree object named
by sha1 and sha256 differ because an object named by sha256-name refers to
other objects by their sha256-names and an object named by sha1-name
refers to other objects by their sha1-names.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sha256-content of an object is the same as its sha1-content, except
that objects referenced by the object are named using their sha256-names
instead of sha1-names. Because a blob object does not refer to any
other object, its sha1-content and sha256-content are the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The format allows round-trip conversion between sha256-content and
sha1-content.</p>

<p>Loose objects use zlib compression and packed objects use the packed

network byte order):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A header appears at the beginning and consists of the following:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 4-byte pack index signature: <em>\377t0c</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4-byte version number: 3</p>

<p>4-byte number of objects contained in the pack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4-byte number of object formats in this pack index: 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each object format:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4-byte format identifier (e.g., <em>sha1</em> for SHA-1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4-byte length in bytes of shortened object names. This is the
shortest possible length needed to make names in the shortened
object name table unambiguous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4-byte integer, recording where tables relating to this format
are stored in this index file, as an offset from the beginning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4-byte offset to the trailer from the beginning of this file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero or more additional key/value pairs (4-byte key, 4-byte
value). Only one key is supported: <em>PSRC</em>. See the "Loose objects
and unreachable objects" section for supported values and how this
is used.  All other keys are reserved. Readers must ignore
unrecognized keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero or more NUL bytes. This can optionally be used to improve the
alignment of the full object name table below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tables for the first object format:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sorted table of shortened object names.  These are prefixes of
the names of all objects in this pack file, packed together
without offset values to reduce the cache footprint of the binary
search for a specific object name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A table of full object names in pack order. This allows resolving
a reference to "the nth object in the pack file" (from a
reachability bitmap or from the next table of another object
format) to its object name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A table of 4-byte values mapping object name order to pack order.
For an object in the table of sorted shortened object names, the
value at the corresponding index in this table is the index in the
previous table for that same object.</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>This can be used to look up the object in reachability bitmaps or
to look up its name in another object format.</pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>A table of 4-byte CRC32 values of the packed object data, in the
order that the objects appear in the pack file. This is to allow
compressed data to be copied directly from pack to pack during
repacking without undetected data corruption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A table of 4-byte offset values. For an object in the table of
sorted shortened object names, the value at the corresponding
index in this table indicates where that object can be found in
the pack file. These are usually 31-bit pack file offsets, but
large offsets are encoded as an index into the next table with the
most significant bit set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A table of 8-byte offset entries (empty for pack files less than
2 GiB). Pack files are organized with heavily used objects toward
the front, so most object references should not need to refer to
this table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero or more NUL bytes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tables for the second object format, with the same layout as above,
up to and not including the table of CRC32 values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero or more NUL bytes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trailer consists of the following:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copy of the 20-byte SHA-256 checksum at the end of the
corresponding packfile.</p>

<div class="olist arabic">

to keep the number of loose objects low. See the "Loose objects and
unreachable objects" section below for more details.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SHA-1s named in the ref advertisement that are present on the client
can be translated to SHA-256 and looked up as local objects using the

<p>Negotiation proceeds as today. Any "have"s generated locally are
converted to SHA-1 before being sent to the server, and SHA-1s
mentioned by the server are converted to SHA-256 when looking them up
locally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After negotiation, the server sends a packfile containing the
requested objects. We convert the packfile to SHA-256 format using
the following steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>index-pack: inflate each object in the packfile and compute its
SHA-1. Objects can contain deltas in OBJ_REF_DELTA format against
objects the client has locally. These objects can be looked up
using the translation table and their sha1-content read as
described above to resolve the deltas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>topological sort: starting at the "want"s from the negotiation
phase, walk through objects in the pack and emit a list of them,
excluding blobs, in reverse topologically sorted order, with each
object coming later in the list than all objects it references.
(This list only contains objects reachable from the "wants". If the
pack from the server contained additional extraneous objects, then
they will be discarded.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>convert to sha256: open a new (sha256) packfile. Read the topologically
sorted list just generated. For each object, inflate its
sha1-content, convert to sha256-content, and write it to the sha256
pack. Record the new sha1&lt;&#8594;sha256 mapping entry for use in the idx.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sort: reorder entries in the new pack to match the order of objects
in the pack the server generated and include blobs. Write a sha256 idx
file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clean up: remove the SHA-1 based pack file, index, and
topologically sorted list obtained from the server in steps 1
and 2.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3 requires every object referenced by the new object to be in the
translation table. This is why the topological sort step is necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an optimization, step 1 could write a file describing what non-blob
objects each object it has inflated from the packfile references. This
makes the topological sort in step 2 possible without inflating the
objects in the packfile for a second time. The objects need to be
inflated again in step 3, for a total of two inflations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4 is probably necessary for good read-time performance. "git
pack-objects" on the server optimizes the pack file for good data
locality (see Documentation/technical/pack-heuristics.txt).</p>
</div>

<p>Details of this process are likely to change. It will take some
experimenting to get this to perform well.</p>

<p>Push is simpler than fetch because the objects referenced by the

send-pack.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fast lookups in the loose-object-idx require that the number of loose
objects not grow too high.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"git gc --auto" currently waits for there to be 6700 loose objects
present before consolidating them into a packfile. We will need to
measure to find a more appropriate threshold for it to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"git gc --auto" currently waits for there to be 50 packs present
before combining packfiles. Packing loose objects more aggressively
may cause the number of pack files to grow too quickly. This can be
mitigated by using a strategy similar to Martin Fick&#8217;s exponential
rolling garbage collection script:
<a href="https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/35215" class="bare">https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/35215</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"git gc" currently expels any unreachable objects it encounters in
pack files to loose objects in an attempt to prevent a race when
pruning them (in case another process is simultaneously writing a new
object that refers to the about-to-be-deleted object). This leads to
an explosion in the number of loose objects present and disk space
usage due to the objects in delta form being replaced with independent
loose objects.  Worse, the race is still present for loose objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, "git gc" will need to move unreachable objects to a new
packfile marked as UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE (using the PSRC field; see
below). To avoid the race when writing new objects referring to an
about-to-be-deleted object, code paths that write new objects will
need to copy any objects from UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE packs that they
refer to new, non-UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE packs (or loose objects).
UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE are then safe to delete if their creation time (as
indicated by the file&#8217;s mtime) is long enough ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To avoid a proliferation of UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE packs, they can be
combined under certain circumstances. If "gc.garbageTtl" is set to
greater than one day, then packs created within a single calendar day,
UTC, can be coalesced together. The resulting packfile would have an
mtime before midnight on that day, so this makes the effective maximum
ttl the garbageTtl + 1 day. If "gc.garbageTtl" is less than one day,
then we divide the calendar day into intervals one-third of that ttl
in duration. Packs created within the same interval can be coalesced
together. The resulting packfile would have an mtime before the end of
the interval, so this makes the effective maximum ttl equal to the
garbageTtl * 4/3.</p>

commit objects without an author or committer). This is a deliberate
feature of the design to allow the conversion to round-trip.</p>

<p>Until Git protocol gains SHA-256 support, using SHA-256 based storage

to support SHA-1 compatibility, to avoid what may be a very expensive
hash re-encode during clone and to encourage peers to modernize.</p>

<p>The design described here allows fetches by SHA-1 clients of a
personal SHA-256 repository because it&#8217;s not much more difficult than

<p>The signed payload for signed commits and tags does not explicitly

intent behind the PGP signed payload in an object signature is
unclear:</p>

<p>To support the transition (see Transition plan below), this design
supports four different modes of operation:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>("dark launch") Treat object names input by the user as SHA-1 and
convert any object names written to output to SHA-1, but store
objects using SHA-256.  This allows users to test the code with no
visible behavior change except for performance.  This allows
allows running even tests that assume the SHA-1 hash function, to
sanity-check the behavior of the new mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>("early transition") Allow both SHA-1 and SHA-256 object names in
input. Any object names written to output use SHA-1. This allows
users to continue to make use of SHA-1 to communicate with peers
(e.g. by email) that have not migrated yet and prepares for mode 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>("late transition") Allow both SHA-1 and SHA-256 object names in
input. Any object names written to output use SHA-256. In this
mode, users are using a more secure object naming method by
default.  The disruption is minimal as long as most of their peers
are in mode 2 or mode 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>("post-transition") Treat object names input by the user as
SHA-256 and write output using SHA-256. This is safer than mode 3
because there is less risk that input is incorrectly interpreted
using the wrong hash function.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In early 2005, around the time that Git was written, Xiaoyun Wang,
Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu announced an attack finding SHA-1
collisions in 2^69 operations. In August they published details.
Luckily, no practical demonstrations of a collision in full SHA-1 were
published until 10 years later, in 2017.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git v2.13.0 and later subsequently moved to a hardened SHA-1

SHA-1 is still believed to be weak.</p>

<p>The hash to replace this hardened SHA-1 should be stronger than SHA-1
was: we would like it to be trustworthy and useful in practice for at

<p>Some other relevant properties:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">

<li>
<p>A 256-bit hash (long enough to match common security practice; not
excessively long to hurt performance and disk usage).</p>

OpenSSL and Apple CommonCrypto).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hash function&#8217;s properties should match Git&#8217;s needs (e.g. Git
requires collision and 2nd preimage resistance and does not require
length extension resistance).</p>

<p>As a tiebreaker, the hash should be fast to compute (fortunately
many contenders are faster than SHA-1).</p>

<h2 id="_transition_plan"><a class="anchor" href="#_transition_plan"></a>Transition plan</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some initial steps can be implemented independently of one another:
- adding a hash function API (vtable)
- teaching fsck to tolerate the gpgsig-sha256 field
- excluding gpgsig-* from the fields copied by "git commit --amend"
- annotating tests that depend on SHA-1 values with a SHA1 test
  prerequisite
- using "struct object_id", GIT_MAX_RAWSZ, and GIT_MAX_HEXSZ
  consistently instead of "unsigned char *" and the hardcoded
  constants 20 and 40.
- introducing index v3
- adding support for the PSRC field and safer object pruning</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first user-visible change is the introduction of the objectFormat
extension (without compatObjectFormat). This requires:
- teaching fsck about this mode of operation
- using the hash function API (vtable) when computing object names
- signing objects and verifying signatures
- rejecting attempts to fetch from or push to an incompatible
  repository</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next comes introduction of compatObjectFormat:
- implementing the loose-object-idx
- translating object names between object formats
- translating object content between object formats
- generating and verifying signatures in the compat format
- adding appropriate index entries when adding a new object to the
  object store
- --output-format option
- ^{sha1} and ^{sha256} revision notation
- configuration to specify default input and output format (see
  "Object names on the command line" above)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next step is supporting fetches and pushes to SHA-1 repositories:
- allow pushes to a repository using the compat format
- generate a topologically sorted list of the SHA-1 names of fetched
  objects
- convert the fetched packfile to sha256 format and generate an idx
  file
- re-sort to match the order of objects in the fetched packfile</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The infrastructure supporting fetch also allows converting an existing
repository. In converted repositories and new clones, end users can
gain support for the new hash function without any visible change in
behavior (see "dark launch" in the "Object names on the command line"
section). In particular this allows users to verify SHA-256 signatures
on objects in the repository, and it should ensure the transition code
is stable in production in preparation for using it more widely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over time projects would encourage their users to adopt the "early
transition" and then "late transition" modes to take advantage of the
new, more futureproof SHA-256 object names.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When objectFormat and compatObjectFormat are both set, commands
generating signatures would generate both SHA-1 and SHA-256 signatures
by default to support both new and old users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In projects using SHA-256 heavily, users could be encouraged to adopt
the "post-transition" mode to avoid accidentally making implicit use
of SHA-1 object names.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a critical mass of users have upgraded to a version of Git that
can verify SHA-256 signatures and have converted their existing
repositories to support verifying them, we can add support for a
setting to generate only SHA-256 signatures. This is expected to be at
least a year later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is also a good moment to advertise the ability to convert
repositories to use SHA-256 only, stripping out all SHA-1 related
metadata. This improves performance by eliminating translation
overhead and security by avoiding the possibility of accidentally
relying on the safety of SHA-1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Updating Git&#8217;s protocols to allow a server to specify which hash
functions it supports is also an important part of this transition. It
is not discussed in detail in this document but this transition plan
assumes it happens. :)</p>

Objects newly created would be addressed by the new hash, but inside
such an object (e.g. commit) it is still possible to address objects
using the old hash function.
* You cannot trust its history (needed for bisectability) in the
  future without further work
* Maintenance burden as the number of supported hash functions grows
  (they will never go away, so they accumulate). In this proposal, by
  comparison, converted objects lose all references to SHA-1.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of introducing the gpgsig-sha256 field in commit and tag objects
for sha256-content based signatures, an earlier version of this design
added "hash sha256 &lt;sha256-name&gt;" fields to strengthen the existing
sha1-content based signatures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, a single signature was used to attest to the object
content using both hash functions. This had some advantages:
* Using one signature instead of two speeds up the signing process.
* Having one signed payload with both hashes allows the signer to
  attest to the sha1-name and sha256-name referring to the same object.
* All users consume the same signature. Broken signatures are likely
  to be detected quickly using current versions of git.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it also came with disadvantages:
* Verifying a signed object requires access to the sha1-names of all
  objects it references, even after the transition is complete and
  translation table is no longer needed for anything else. To support
  this, the design added fields such as "hash sha1 tree &lt;sha1-name&gt;"
  and "hash sha1 parent &lt;sha1-name&gt;" to the sha256-content of a signed
  commit, complicating the conversion process.
* Allowing signed objects without a sha1 (for after the transition is
  complete) complicated the design further, requiring a "nohash sha1"
  field to suppress including "hash sha1" fields in the sha256-content
  and signed payload.</p>

an acceptable cost.</p>
