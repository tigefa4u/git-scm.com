<pre>git-quiltimport - Applies a quilt patchset onto the current branch


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git quiltimport' [--dry-run | -n] [--author &lt;author&gt;] [--patches &lt;dir&gt;]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Applies a quilt patchset onto the current Git branch, preserving
the patch boundaries, patch order, and patch descriptions present
in the quilt patchset.

For each patch the code attempts to extract the author from the
patch description.  If that fails it falls back to the author
specified with --author.  If the --author flag was not given
the patch description is displayed and the user is asked to
interactively enter the author of the patch.

If a subject is not found in the patch description the patch name is
preserved as the 1 line subject in the Git description.

OPTIONS
-------

-n::
--dry-run::
	Walk through the patches in the series and warn
	if we cannot find all of the necessary information to commit
	a patch.  At the time of this writing only missing author
	information is warned about.

--author Author Name &lt;Author Email&gt;::
	The author name and email address to use when no author
	information can be found in the patch description.

--patches &lt;dir&gt;::
	The directory to find the quilt patches and the
	quilt series file.
+
The default for the patch directory is patches
or the value of the $QUILT_PATCHES environment
variable.
