<div class="title">Definition</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shallow commits do have parents, but not in the shallow
repo, and therefore grafts are introduced pretending that
these commits have no parents.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic idea is to write the SHA-1s of shallow commits into
$GIT_DIR/shallow, and handle its contents like the contents
of $GIT_DIR/info/grafts (with the difference that shallow
cannot contain parent information).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This information is stored in a new file instead of grafts, or
even the config, since the user should not touch that file
at all (even throughout development of the shallow clone, it
was never manually edited!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each line contains exactly one SHA-1. When read, a commit_graft
will be constructed, which has nr_parent &lt; 0 to make it easier
to discern from user provided grafts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since fsck-objects relies on the library to read the objects,
it honours shallow commits automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are some unfinished ends of the whole shallow business:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>maybe we have to force non-thin packs when fetching into a
shallow repo (ATM they are forced non-thin).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A special handling of a shallow upstream is needed. At some
stage, upload-pack has to check if it sends a shallow commit,
and it should send that information early (or fail, if the
client does not support shallow repositories). There is no
support at all for this in this patch series.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of locking $GIT_DIR/shallow at the start, just
the timestamp of it is noted, and when it comes to writing it,
a check is performed if the mtime is still the same, dying if
it is not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is unclear how "push into/from a shallow repo" should behave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you deepen a history, you&#8217;d want to get the tags of the
newly stored (but older!) commits. This does not work right now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make a shallow clone, you can call "git-clone --depth 20 repo".
The result contains only commit chains with a length of at most 20.
It also writes an appropriate $GIT_DIR/shallow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can deepen a shallow repository with "git-fetch --depth 20
repo branch", which will fetch branch from repo, but stop at depth
20, updating $GIT_DIR/shallow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The special depth 2147483647 (or 0x7fffffff, the largest positive
number a signed 32-bit integer can contain) means infinite depth.</p>
