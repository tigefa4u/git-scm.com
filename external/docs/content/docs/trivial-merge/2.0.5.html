<p>Only #2ALT and #3ALT use <strong>empty</strong>, because these are the only cases
where there can be conflicts that didn&#8217;t exist before. Note that we
allow directory-file conflicts between things in different stages
after the trivial merge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A possible alternative for #6 is (empty), which would make it like
#1. This is not used, due to the likelihood that it arises due to
moving the file to multiple different locations or moving and deleting
it in different branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Case #1 is included for completeness, and also in case we decide to
put on <em>+</em> markings; any path that is never mentioned at all isn&#8217;t
handled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that #16 is when both #13 and #14 apply; in this case, we refuse
the trivial merge, because we can&#8217;t tell from this data which is
right. This is a case of a reverted patch (in some direction, maybe
multiple times), and the right answer depends on looking at crossings
of history or common ancestors of the ancestors.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that, between #6, #7, #9, and #11, all cases not otherwise
covered are handled in this table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For #8 and #10, there is alternative behavior, not currently
implemented, where the result is (empty). As currently implemented,
the automatic merge will generally give this effect.</p>
