<p>You could omit &lt;branch&gt;, in which case the command degenerates to

<p>Specifying <code>-b</code> causes a new branch to be created as if

this case you can use the <code>--track</code> or <code>--no-track</code> options,

<code>--track</code> without <code>-b</code> implies branch creation; see the
description of <code>--track</code> below.</p>

<p>Prepare to work on top of &lt;commit&gt;, by detaching HEAD at it
(see "DETACHED HEAD" section), and updating the index and the
files in the working tree.  Local modifications to the files
in the working tree are kept, so that the resulting working

modifications.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the &lt;commit&gt; argument is a branch name, the <code>--detach</code> option can
be used to detach HEAD at the tip of the branch (<code>git checkout

<p>The index may contain unmerged entries because of a previous failed merge.
By default, if you try to check out such an entry from the index, the
checkout operation will fail and nothing will be checked out.
Using <code>-f</code> will ignore these unmerged entries.  The contents from a
specific side of the merge can be checked out of the index by
using <code>--ours</code> or <code>--theirs</code>.  With <code>-m</code>, changes made to the working tree
file can be discarded to re-create the original conflicted merge result.</p>

work done on the branch you are rebasing as the third-party work to
be integrated, and you are temporarily assuming the role of the
keeper of the canonical history during the rebase.  As the keeper of
the canonical history, you need to view the history from the remote
as <code>ours</code> (i.e. "our shared canonical history"), while what you did
on your side branch as <code>theirs</code> (i.e. "one contributor&#8217;s work on top
of it").</p>

<p>If no <code>-b</code> option is given, the name of the new branch will be
derived from the remote-tracking branch, by looking at the local part of
the refspec configured for the corresponding remote, and then stripping
the initial part up to the "*".
This would tell us to use "hack" as the local branch when branching
off of "origin/hack" (or "remotes/origin/hack", or even
"refs/remotes/origin/hack").  If the given name has no slash, or the above
guessing results in an empty name, the guessing is aborted.  You can

new branch will have no parents and it will be the root of a new
history totally disconnected from all the other branches and
commits.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The index and the working tree are adjusted as if you had previously run
"git checkout &lt;start_point&gt;".  This allows you to start a new history
that records a set of paths similar to &lt;start_point&gt; by easily running
"git commit -a" to make the root commit.</p>

<p>This can be useful when you want to publish the tree from a commit
without exposing its full history. You might want to do this to publish
an open source branch of a project whose current tree is "clean", but

code.</p>
</div>

<p>If you want to start a disconnected history that records a set of paths
that is totally different from the one of &lt;start_point&gt;, then you should
clear the index and the working tree right after creating the orphan
branch by running "git rm -rf ." from the top level of the working tree.
Afterwards you will be ready to prepare your new files, repopulating the
working tree, by copying them from elsewhere, extracting a tarball, etc.</p>

<p>When switching branches,
if you have local modifications to one or more files that
are different between the current branch and the branch to
which you are switching, the command refuses to switch
branches in order to preserve your modifications in context.
However, with this option, a three-way merge between the current
branch, your working tree contents, and the new branch
is done, and you will be on the new branch.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a merge conflict happens, the index entries for conflicting
paths are left unmerged, and you need to resolve the conflicts
and mark the resolved paths with <code>git add</code> (or <code>git rm</code> if the merge
should result in deletion of the path).</p>

<p>If we have moved away from commit <em>f</em>, then we must first recover its object

it. For example, to see the last two commits to which HEAD referred, we
can use either of these commands:</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When there is only one argument given and it is not <code>--</code> (e.g. "git
checkout abc"), and when the argument is both a valid <code>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</code>
(e.g. a branch "abc" exists) and a valid <code>&lt;pathspec&gt;</code> (e.g. a file
or a directory whose name is "abc" exists), Git would usually ask
you to disambiguate.  Because checking out a branch is so common an
operation, however, "git checkout abc" takes "abc" as a <code>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</code>
in such a situation.  Use <code>git checkout -- &lt;pathspec&gt;</code> if you want
to checkout these paths out of the index.</p>

<p>Note the quotes around <code>*.c</code>.  The file <code>hello.c</code> will also be

<p>If you have an unfortunate branch that is named <code>hello.c</code>, this
step would be confused as an instruction to switch to that branch.

<p>After working in the wrong branch, switching to the correct
branch would be done using:</p>

<p>However, your "wrong" branch and correct "mytopic" branch may

the above checkout would fail like this:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git checkout mytopic
error: You have local changes to 'frotz'; not switching branches.</pre>
</div>

<p>You can give the <code>-m</code> flag to the command, which would try a
three-way merge:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git checkout -m mytopic
Auto-merging frotz</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After this three-way merge, the local modifications are <em>not</em>
registered in your index file, so <code>git diff</code> would show you what
changes you made since the tip of the new branch.</p>

<li>
<p>When a merge conflict happens during switching branches with
the <code>-m</code> option, you would see something like this:</p>

Auto-merging frotz
ERROR: Merge conflict in frotz
fatal: merge program failed</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, <code>git diff</code> shows the changes cleanly merged as in

<code>git add</code> as usual:</p>
