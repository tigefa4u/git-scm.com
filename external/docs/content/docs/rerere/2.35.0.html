<h2 id="_conflict_normalization"><a class="anchor" href="#_conflict_normalization"></a>Conflict normalization</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To ensure recorded conflict resolutions can be looked up in the rerere
database, even when branches are merged in a different order,
different branches are merged that result in the same conflict, or
when different conflict style settings are used, rerere normalizes the
conflicts before writing them to the rerere database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Different conflict styles and branch names are normalized by stripping
the labels from the conflict markers, and removing the common ancestor
version from the <code>diff3</code> or <code>zdiff3</code> conflict styles.  Branches that
are merged in different order are normalized by sorting the conflict
hunks.  More on each of those steps in the following sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once these two normalization operations are applied, a conflict ID is
calculated based on the normalized conflict, which is later used by
rerere to look up the conflict in the rerere database.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_removing_the_common_ancestor_version"><a class="anchor" href="#_removing_the_common_ancestor_version"></a>Removing the common ancestor version</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Say we have three branches AB, AC and AC2.  The common ancestor of
these branches has a file with a line containing the string "A" (for
brevity this is called "line A" in the rest of the document).  In
branch AB this line is changed to "B", in AC, this line is changed to
"C", and branch AC2 is forked off of AC, after the line was changed to
"C".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Forking a branch ABAC off of branch AB and then merging AC into it, we
get a conflict like the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
B
=======
C
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AC</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Doing the analogous with AC2 (forking a branch ABAC2 off of branch AB
and then merging branch AC2 into it), using the diff3 or zdiff3
conflict style, we get a conflict like the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
B
||||||| merged common ancestors
A
=======
C
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AC2</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By resolving this conflict, to leave line D, the user declares:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>After examining what branches AB and AC did, I believe that making
line A into line D is the best thing to do that is compatible with
what AB and AC wanted to do.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As branch AC2 refers to the same commit as AC, the above implies that
this is also compatible what AB and AC2 wanted to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By extension, this means that rerere should recognize that the above
conflicts are the same.  To do this, the labels on the conflict
markers are stripped, and the common ancestor version is removed.  The above
examples would both result in the following normalized conflict:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
B
=======
C
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sorting_hunks"><a class="anchor" href="#_sorting_hunks"></a>Sorting hunks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As before, lets imagine that a common ancestor had a file with line A
its early part, and line X in its late part.  And then four branches
are forked that do these things:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>AB: changes A to B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AC: changes A to C</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XY: changes X to Y</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XZ: changes X to Z</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, forking a branch ABAC off of branch AB and then merging AC into
it, and forking a branch ACAB off of branch AC and then merging AB
into it, would yield the conflict in a different order.  The former
would say "A became B or C, what now?" while the latter would say "A
became C or B, what now?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a reminder, the act of merging AC into ABAC and resolving the
conflict to leave line D means that the user declares:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>After examining what branches AB and AC did, I believe that
making line A into line D is the best thing to do that is
compatible with what AB and AC wanted to do.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the conflict we would see when merging AB into ACAB should be
resolved the same way---it is the resolution that is in line with that
declaration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine that similarly previously a branch XYXZ was forked from XY,
and XZ was merged into it, and resolved "X became Y or Z" into "X
became W".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, if a branch ABXY was forked from AB and then merged XY, then ABXY
would have line B in its early part and line Y in its later part.
Such a merge would be quite clean.  We can construct 4 combinations
using these four branches AB, AC) x (XY, XZ.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Merging ABXY and ACXZ would make "an early A became B or C, a late X
became Y or Z" conflict, while merging ACXY and ABXZ would make "an
early A became C or B, a late X became Y or Z".  We can see there are
4 combinations of ("B or C", "C or B") x ("X or Y", "Y or X").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By sorting, the conflict is given its canonical name, namely, "an
early part became B or C, a late part became X or Y", and whenever
any of these four patterns appear, and we can get to the same conflict
and resolution that we saw earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without the sorting, we&#8217;d have to somehow find a previous resolution
from combinatorial explosion.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_conflict_id_calculation"><a class="anchor" href="#_conflict_id_calculation"></a>Conflict ID calculation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the conflict normalization is done, the conflict ID is calculated
as the sha1 hash of the conflict hunks appended to each other,
separated by &lt;NUL&gt; characters.  The conflict markers are stripped out
before the sha1 is calculated.  So in the example above, where we
merge branch AC which changes line A to line C, into branch AB, which
changes line A to line C, the conflict ID would be
SHA1(<em>B&lt;NUL&gt;C&lt;NUL&gt;</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there are multiple conflicts in one file, the sha1 is calculated
the same way with all hunks appended to each other, in the order in
which they appear in the file, separated by a &lt;NUL&gt; character.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_nested_conflicts"><a class="anchor" href="#_nested_conflicts"></a>Nested conflicts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nested conflicts are handled very similarly to "simple" conflicts.
Similar to simple conflicts, the conflict is first normalized by
stripping the labels from conflict markers, stripping the common ancestor
version, and the sorting the conflict hunks, both for the outer and the
inner conflict.  This is done recursively, so any number of nested
conflicts can be handled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this only works for conflict markers that "cleanly nest".  If
there are any unmatched conflict markers, rerere will fail to handle
the conflict and record a conflict resolution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only difference is in how the conflict ID is calculated.  For the
inner conflict, the conflict markers themselves are not stripped out
before calculating the sha1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Say we have the following conflict for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
1
=======
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
3
=======
2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-3~</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After stripping out the labels of the conflict markers, and sorting
the hunks, the conflict would look as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
1
=======
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
2
=======
3
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and finally the conflict ID would be calculated as:
<code>sha1('1&lt;NUL&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n3\n=======\n2\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;NUL&gt;')</code></p>
</div>
